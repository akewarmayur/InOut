INSERT INTO `topicdiscussion` VALUES (92,279,1,'Hi,\nThis is my first writeup on VP, so consider any lapses kindly. I will keep the writeup short, and based on questions or conversations, attempt to find and update related information.\nI wish to draw attention to a small scale regional player in plastic pipes - Prakash Pipes- PPFL.\nPrimary investment thesis - A subsidiary business with impressive performance while the primary business is likely to benefit from the tailwinds in the plastic pipes space.\nBusiness history - Primary promoter in business since 1981. Initially part of Prakash industries which also has interests in steel, power and mining (Refer thread on Prakash Industries on VP). PVC pipes and plastics division demerged out in 2019 into separate entity with investors getting shares in ratio 8:1. (for 8 in parent, get 1 in new). Company starts trading on BSE/NSE as separate entity from June, 2019.\nCurrent Business - Initially, as part of Prakash industries, PPFL was primarily a plastic pipes company. While plastic pipes industry faces reasonable tailwinds in the business today, Prakash pipes is relatively small and decent regional player in the north (UP primarily and then the Delhi, Haryana and Northwards belt, with influence gradually diminishing as we move north east or south). In 2018, however, PPFL diversified into the flexible packaging space. The key attractiveness of the business lies in the flexible packaging division which is growing at an incredible rate.\nThe story in numbers is as follows -\nParticulars FY19 FY20 9MFY21\nTotal Revenue 345.6 389.2 342.4\nEBITDA 43.2 42.4 43.6\nEBITDA margin (%) 12.50% 10.90% 12.70%\nDepreciation 4.7 6.5 6\nInterest 0.2 1.6 1.5\nProfit Before Tax 38.3 34.3 36.2\nIncome Tax 9.7 9.5 10.5\nProfit After Tax 28.6 24.8 25.6\nPAT margin (%) 8.30% 6.40% 7.50%\nSales Volume (MTPA) FY19 FY20 9MFY21\nPipes & Fittings 42,012 43,305 28,025\nFlexible Packaging 316 3,227 5,227\nCurrent year highlights (Q3 - Fy2021)\nQuarter Ended Dec, 2020\nRevenue - INR 127 Crores, up by 37% (YoY)\nEBITDA - INR 16 Crores, up by 63% (YoY)\nProfit After Tax - INR 9 Crores, up by 25% (YoY)\n9 Months Ended Dec, 2020\nRevenue - INR 342 Crores, up by 14% (YoY)\nEBITDA - INR 44 Crores, up by 34% (YoY)\nProfit After Tax - INR 26 Crores, up by 25% (YoY)\nPipes & Fittings Division\nRecorded sales volume of 10,013 tonnes in Q3FY21, up by 4% (YoY)\nContribution of the Fittings in the sales mix has increased to 7%, up by 83% (YoY)\nInstalled 3 new Moulding machines to expand the Fittings range\nAdded Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC) Pipes & Fittings in the product range\nFlexible Packaging Division\nSales volume grew by 60% (YoY) in Q3FY21\nIncreased capacity by commissioning 3rd Printing Machine\nCommissioned Rotogravure Cylinder plant as a step towards backward integration\nIncremental planned Capex - Company is planning significant further Capex in both its divisions, as of now, all funded through internal accruals.\nCapex Current Target FY21/22 Percent Increase\nPipes & Fittings 55000 TPA 67000 TPA 22%\nFlexible Packaging 9600 TPA 19200 TPA 100%\nIt is interesting to note that flexible packaging incremental capex is comparable (12000 TPA to 9600 TPA) to its long standing pipes division in absolute terms, while in percentage terms absolutely blows the pipes capex out of the water (at 22pc vs 100 pc that’s a no-contest really) and in my opinion indicative of where the management thinks future profits will be from.\nFrom screener, With ROCE at healthy 29%, EPS of 14, P/E of 10, and debt-free, it seems pretty fairly valued with respect to its pipes competitions as well as packaging competition.\nShort Business Note - Pipes\nCurrent plant at Kashipur UP.\n500+ dealer and distributor network\nfavorable tailwinds with consolidation in pipes industry and Jal Jeevan Mission, Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana.\nFor a fuller discussion of the pipes industry please check this link - https://www.valuequest.in/deep-dive-series-plastic-pipes/ 10\nShort Business Note - Flexible Packaging -\nagain, plant at Kashipur UP.\nbackward integration with printing inks, blown PE films and Rotogravure cylinders.\nvery healthy client list with repeat business across FMCG, food and Infrastructure/Others.\nOverall, company looks favorably poised to benefit from the pipe industry tailwinds, with the flexible packaging division serving as the cherry on the pie.

India imports 56% of its PVC resin needs. Larger players have better cost efficiencies in procurement. Not sure where PPFL stands in this regard. PVC resin import also has ADD (Anti Dumping Duty) applicable, but again, whether that’s a good thing or bad thing for smaller players is subjective based on costs involved for the player and the ability to pass the cost downwards to its customers…\nPromoter risk - Prakash Industries, the founding company, is involved in lawsuits filed by CBI against certain operations of its mining businesses.\nBusiness and prospects details -\nPipes - the value quest article above is a good starting point.

The investigation further revealed that to take advantage of the ‘artificially created rise in the share value’, the company issued 62,50,000 preferential shares on a premium of Rs 180 per share and sold these shares to five companies making a gain of 118.75 crores.\n“The amount of Rs 118.75 crores, which was generated as a result of the schedule offence as committed on the date of filing of application for allocation of coal block by giving false net worth details and further false declaration to BSE, is the proceeds of crime, which are liable to be provisionally attached under PMLA,” says a media statement by Enforcement Directorate.\nI quote from a similar 2021 article 2:\nCBI Article:\nThe CBI has sought government’s permission to charge three bureaucrats, two of whom are retired, in a coal scam case they had closed for want of evidence, but reopened based on application by senior BJP leaders, also complainants in case.\nThe CBI had filed a case against Prakash Industries and its directors in 2014 on the complaints of Union Minister Prakash Javdekar and senior BJP leaders Hans Raj Ahir and Bhupender Yadav.\nThe three BJP leaders, being the complainants, had opposed the closure report in the CBI court and sought further investigation, which the CBI agreed to on March 9, 2018.\nAs per the ED article The promoters have been involved directly in wrong filings with exchanges leading to stock price manipulation. As per the CBI article there are political risks as well with some tussle between leaders of ruling party. IMO the promoter entity related risks are far too high. Specially in a microcap like prakash where most information is already opaque (no concalls), it becomes very difficult to trust anything coming out of a promoter entity which has previously been accused of wrong BSE filings. IMHO avoiding permanent loss of capital is and should always be the first course of action when deciding where to invest one;\'s monies. We don’t need to hit a shot on every ball that is pitched to us. Due to serious risks WRT the promoter entity, IMV any time spend on business analysis would be time I could spend analyzing any other business, because anyway a meaningful allocation cannot be made to a microcap where promoter entities have open ED and CBI cases directly related to stock manipulation. With serious cases like these, it anyways becomes very difficult for an investor to expect any serious rerating of the underlying business.

They are analogous to petrochemicals derived from petroleum). The company produces a wide range of specialty plant derived oleochemicals-based additives used in the food, plastic, cosmetics, paint, ink, coatings and other specialty application in various industries sold under the \'Fine Organics’ brand.\nFOIL is the largest manufacturer of oleochemicals-based additives in India and a strong player globally in this industry. It has 631 direct customers and 127 distributors from 69 countries. The company has a well-diversified and reputed customer base. In the petrochemical segment, FOIL caters to companies like Reliance Industries Limited, GAIL, Haldia Petrochemicals Limited, SABIC (Saudi Arabia), Petronas (Malaysia), Braskem (Brazil), Petkim (Turkey), Quapco (Qatar), Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemicals, etc. Further, in the foods segment, the company supplies its products to companies like HUL, Mondelez, Coca Cola, Britannia, Parle, etc. No customer accounts for more than 5% of the overall sales.\nSpecialised products and business model:\nManufacturing additives from base oleochemicals is a highly complex process as it involves technical know-how and R&D for product innovationwhich makes specialty and formulated products difficult to replicate. This provides it with a significant advantage over new entrants, as they would need to invest a great deal of resources to gain a foothold in the markets.\nIndustry is largely Oligopolistic in nature:\nPresence of Multiple entry-barriers such as product formulations, process technology and customer stickiness to established players. All the established players are enjoying their first-mover advantages. For an entry into this industry, new players won’t be able to procure product formulations and process technology from established players, which are reluctant to share their technology and other intellectual properties.\nStrong R&D capability with a focus on innovation:\nFOIL has created new additives and downstream products, such as Acetem, Datem, and Lactem. It is in the process of developing a downstream product called Citrem, which is a hydrophilic (attracted to water molecules and water-soluble) emulsifier used in the confectionary industry. R&D efforts are driven by customer needs, in terms of meeting specific needs that its direct customers communicate to the company prior to us manufacturing its products.

Further, debt has reduced consistently over the last few years and a large part of the company’s current debt includes unsecured promoter loans. With efficient supply chain management, FOIL consistently has exhibited a good ROCE level since past many years.\nExpansion of production facilities and strategic JV tie-ups to augur next phase of growth:\nFOIL currently has three production facilities: one in Ambernath (Maharashtra/ Plant 1); one in Badlapur (Maharashtra); and one in Dombivli (Maharashtra). The company also manufactures some of its products on contract basis through its group companies at its second facility in Ambernath (to be taken over by FY18 end).\n\na) FOIL is currently planning to set up an additional production facility in Ambernath (plant 3) with a planned installed capacity of 32,000 tonnes per annum funding through 2.3:1 Debt/Equity mix.\nb) Patalganga and Ambernath Plant 4 – Preliminary Stages of Planning:\ni) The Patalganga Facility will have a planned initial installed capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum for additive products. FOIL has not yet decided on a date of commencement of operation for this facility. The estimated cost of setting up the Patalganga Facility is Rs. 50crs .\nii) In December 2013, FOIL paid Rs.24.2crs for a plot of land on which it plans to build its Fourth Ambernath Facility.

Further academic credentials from UICT Mumbai also give comfort in promoters who are technocrats and have the know-how in the oldeochemicals industry.\nKey Risk:\na) Largely fixed nature of contracts (albeit LT in nature) exposing companies to volatility in RM prices\nPrimary raw materials are derived from vegetable oils, including rapeseed oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, sunflower oil, castor oil, soybean oil, rice bran oil. The company enters into ST contract arrangements with its suppliers (<6 months) which exposes it to RM volatility risks. Further, most of the contracts FOIL has with its customers are LT in nature but are albeit fixed in nature (ie. Lumpsum contracts and without any minimum offtake arrangement). They also contain a meet or release’ provision, i.e., a provision pursuant to which a purchaser may terminate the agreement if FOIL does not agree to meet any lower offers that the purchaser receives from other suppliers which could also result in cash flow volatility.\nb) Supplier concentration risks:\nHeavy reliance on few suppliers which can indicate stringent payment terms and limited bargaining power also prone to risks of steady supply of procurements.\nVALUATIONS:\nThe company claims to be amongst the few suppliers for its products globally.\nAt current multiples of ~ 17x stock is neither expensive nor too cheap.

Kama owns 52% of the share count of SRF, or 30 million shares. At current valuations, this holding amounts to \'3,900 crore, indicating a discount of 80% to the value of just SRF held.\nSRF paid a dividend of \'10 per share in FY15, implying a net inflow of \'30 crore for Kama Holdings as dividends for the year. Kama’s investment on books into SRF stands at \'404 crore. Kama increased its holding in SRF by 1 million shares from 29 million as of end-FY13. This is a positive indicator of financial health through an open market buyback. It is instructive to note that this was done at an average price of approximately \'162/share, a very good acquisitive price. Today, SRF is worth \'7,400 crore or \'1,275 per share.\nAs my friend and passionate value investor, Krishnaraj V (fondly known as Kimi) puts it: “A company should be known by the companies it keeps”. So, is SRF a good underlying investment? Let’s delve briefly into SRF.\nSRF enjoys a global leadership position in its technical textiles business. It is a domestic leader in various other business lines such as refrigerants, engineering plastics, industrial yarns, polyester films and fluorospecialities, In FY15, SRF earned its revenues at an operating margin exceeding 25% on its consolidated business, after two years of sub-optimal margin performance. Note that this was despite strikes and inventory write-downs. Returns on average Net Worth stood at 13%, while pre-tax ROCE stood at 11%. Working capital requirements remain high for SRF thereby depressing capital returns during its growth phase. Debt to Equity (D/E) ratio stands at 1.0x. The promoters are known to be able and honest in their dealings, and have interests aligned with that of the company (through a cumulative 75% stake in the firm, inclusive of that held by Kama). While we should not expect more rapid growth in revenues, better operating margins through lower input costs, should enable profitability to increase faster than topline.\nPer SRF’s FY14-15 Annual Report, Amansa Capital, a fund run by noted value investor Akash Prakash, started buying into SRF in May-2014 and now owns 5% (or 2.9 million shares) as of June-2015. Akash Prakash has the uncanny ability to buy undervalued businesses which blossom over a 3-5 year horizon, producing extraordinary long term gains. Examples include Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland, Whirlpool, among others. The list of investors is long and noteworthy. A glance through the Annual Report or Company Shareholding Pattern would disclose further details.\nThere seem to be two possibilities:\nKama’s holding discount narrows over time, compounding Kama’s returns faster than that of SRF’s.\nOR\nKama Holdings mirrors the returns of SRF, implying the discount stays at a deep 80% to holding value.\nIn any case, the probability of the discount deepening further seems less likely than its narrowing, creating a substantial margin of safety.\nA case of ‘Heads I win, Tails I don’t lose much’.\nDisclosure: I do not own shares in SRF Limited or Kama Holdings Limited','Jul 28, 2015 12:13 am'),(240,284,8,'@hash611\nThanks for the idea - the way one should look at holding companies is through a dividend discount model. If Rs. 30 Cr. is the dividend this year, extrapolate it for sy 15 years and then take a steady dividend post and discount it.\nAt 27 x current dividends, it seems fairly valued. A point to note is that these holding companies are like “permafrost” - a minority shareholder typically waits for a glacier to melt so that he can drink some water. If the glacier is never going to melt, it might be “waiting for godot” - I learnt it the hard way,\nOne thumb rule I use is to not pay more than 15-17 x dividend inflows. Much, in this case, will depend on SRF’ ability to generate free cash flows and hence increase dividend - one must remeber that SRF is a cyclical business and if you look at 10 year track record of creating FCF’s its not much - the business waxes and wanes in 3-4 year cycles.

So as against Rs 10 per share dividend in SRF, Kama gets 46.5 Dividend per share. IF same get distributed to shareholder (as we see from FY15 dividend distribution trends), the price discount to Kama and SRF should decline due to arbitrage opportunity of dividend. Currently, both SRF and Kama are almost trading at same price. The increased dividend payment in Kama, if only one time exception in FY15, then my logic would defy and discount rate would continue same/ or may increase.\nI have also invested in Bajaj Holding, Bengal Assam/ Florence (JK Group Hodlco), Kalayani Investment (Bharat Forge Holdco).

Whether SRF is overvalued or not, may be another question altogether. The point I am making is both SRF and Kama Holding are trading at Rs 1300. SRF give dividend of Rs 10 per share.

Of these Rs 46.5, let us assume that decide to distribute 50% as dividend (around 23.25 actual being 20 per share).\nSo other thing being same, with almost 80% holdco discount (hence scope for increase is possible, but very limited chance because factor highlighted in previous post), would give almost double dividend yield as compared with SRF.

COGS was 58% in FY13, then fell steadily to 42% in FY17 just as SR prices declined from their peak in end of 2011.\nSynthetic rubber is a crude oil derivative and crude levels are expected to increase (moderately?) over next 1-2 years.This could erode PIX’s margins. 10% increase in COGS can result in OPM going down from ~20% to ~16% or a ~20% fall!\nLow interest coverage (FY 16 @1.4 and FY17 @2.5) exposing PAT to interest rate rise (RBI can very possibly increase rates in 2018).\nI could not find any references in recent ARs on debt reduction plans and/or liquidation of current assets/ investments. Was there any mention in conf. calls or elsewhere?\nHistorically wafer thin net profit margin (~2%) questioning PIX’s “brand” value and moat. A reference was made to this also by @param77 earlier in the thread. Why should we expect that Sales growth will lead to accelerated profit growth?\nHigh promoter remuneration as % of PAT.

If hertz (American bankrupt car leasing company) can rally 600% after declaring bankruptcy, then anything can happen in the short term imo.\nOn the company performance front, I’m quite interested in tracking the performance of the injectibles business the margins and roce for that segment. That should also help instill confidence in investors about the durability of the growth for the business. On the other hand, if the injectibles businesses grows while shrinking margins and roces too much, then it would make investors (including me) want to exit the stock.\nAlso I want to point out that the roe and roce can and will improve in the coming quarters since capex works that way. You invest capital at time X, and returns are slowly generated from this asset over next k years (capacity utilisation does not start off being 100% in first quarter after the starting of the new factory). So the roce increases again going from trough to peak then some more capex, lower roces and the cycle goes on.','Jun 30, 2020 12:42 pm'),(295,286,99,'Mathhews india fund continuously selling caplin. see their shareholding continuously coming down.','Jun 30, 2020 12:54 pm'),(296,286,100,'They just finished their Capex, which has not yet started paying off.

There are other listed NBFC-MFIs (Satin CreditCare and Spandana) however CreditAccess Grameen/Grameen Koota (referred to as GK or CAG hereon) operates a far superior business vis-à-vis the other MFIs.\nIn order to analyse the business, I have gone with the approach of understanding the business and its functioning and post that only arriving at the financial performance analysis, so that at least I am able to figure out what’s driving the financial performance before presenting the numbers.\nSome glossary/key words used in the post:\nCRE: Customer Relationship Executive - This is the person who performs the front-line operations of sourcing of customers, formation of group, doing the collections as part of the group meetings\nGLP: Gross Loan Portfolio - This is the total loan outstanding that the MFI is handling. It can include loans on the MFI’s own balance sheet, loans securitised by the MFI to bankers or other NBFCs, as well as direct assingment/BC portfolio\nDPD: Days Past Due - This means how many days is the loan EMI past its repayment date. i.e. if the loan EMI is expected to be paid of 1st of March and the customer hasn’t paid the loan till 15th March then the loan becomes DPD 15\nPAR: Portfolio At Risk - This is the sum total of the GLP for which on-time repayments have not been received by the MFI. This is similar to DPD. So if a MFI says PAR 30+ is 50 Cr and 2% of portfolio then it means Rs. 50 Crore of loans are overdue for more than 30 days and is 2% of GLP\nCase Load: Number of clients handled per CRE. Higher the case load, the better it is from productivity perspective\nJLG Loans: Joint Liability Group loans are unsecured loans which are disbursed to a group of borrowers, where apart from the borrower’s ability to pay the social pressure of the group incentivizes the customer to pay back the loan. While the loans are disbursed to and used individually, the liability of repayment is on the group.\nBackground of GK’s promoter:\nGK, was incorporated in 1991 as Sanni Collection Private Limited and before turning into a NBFC-MFI it was already engaged in the business of providing micro-loans in Karnataka.\nPost the AP-crisis, the company obtained the NBFC-MFI license from the RBI in Jul,2013 and was called Grameen Koota.\nIn 2014, CreditAccess Asia N.V (“CAA is primarily engaged in providing, through controlled companies, financial services to micro and small businesses and self-employed people in emerging countries. CAA also participates in, finances or conducts the management of other companies or enterprises. Presently, CAA has investments in micro-finance institutions in India, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.”) as part of the acquisition, GK was rebranded as CreditAccess Grameen (“CAG”)\nAs part of the transaction CAA acquired 99% of the stake in the company and post the IPO hold 80% in the company (therefore within the next 2 years there is a 5% dilution that CAA will have to do in GK).\nMain Point: GK has international parentage of promoters who are focused on providing micro-credit internationally, hold majority of the shareholding and therefore their interest should largely be aligned with the interest of the shareholders.\nIndustry:\nAs there is a parallel thread going on the MFI industry, I am not covering the details of the industry, its size and future potential (refer here: Link 13).\n• The key latest information about the Microfinance and MFI industry are below (as of Q3 FY 20):\no Size: Rs. 2.11 Lakh Crore\nDPD 180+: Rs. 2900 Crore\nActive Loan Accounts: 10.11 Crore\nAvg.

Therefore within a group the following differences can occur:\nThe loan amount can differ across members of the group\nThe interest rate among the members also differs based on their vintage of relationship with GK as well as other parameters, such as repayment behavior as well as the center’s vintage with GK\nThe repayment frequency is decided by the customer, however the meeting happens on a weekly basis. This allows the customers to align their repayment frequency with their cashflows. Current repayment mix: 55.5% weekly, 38.3% bi-weekly, 6.1% monthly\nBenefit of such methodology: The loan product is customized to each customer’s behavior, vis-à-vis other lender’s approach of pushing their product prototype thus leading to customer satisfaction\nOther products:\nAs an NBFC-MFI, 85% of the products have to be JLG, and therefore the MFIs have an option to expand into other products and slowly and steadily majority of the MFIs especially the larger ones are have done so.\nGK also in the same way has also expanded its product offerings which provides GK the following benefits:\nCustomers who mature across the loan cycles and have higher loan requirements can avail these loans and not be restricted by the MFIN/RBI guidelines, thus the customer is retained within the GK ecosystem\nGK is able to charge higher interest rates from the customer as the ticket size is higher and is not restricted by the 10% margin cap\nFollowing is the product offerings of the top MFIs, along with the ticket sizes (as disclosed by the MFIs)\nNon JLG product strategy: As mentioned earlier, GK has started offering the non-JLG products to its existing customers (internally referred by GK as “Retail Finance”). In order to provide these products to its customer while not directly cannibalising the JLG business it has defined an eligibility criteria [atleast three year customer of GK with good repayment behaviour], and GK understands that the CRE for JLG customer is different from individual loans, and therefore has created a separate sales channel. The details of the progress of the product is mentioned below:\nProduct & Performance\n• Upto Rs. 5 Lakhs, upto 5 years with 20-22%\n• Avg. O/S: 66K with Avg. Ticket Size: 90K\n• 100% Monthly collection\n• Retail Finance Product up from 3.3% of GLP to 5.1% YoY\n• GNPA: 0.24%\nRetail Financing Channel\n• Branches: 70\n• Employee: 1100, CRE: 695\n• Portfolio per branch: 6.5 Cr\n• Portfolio per CRE: 0.7 Cr\n• Borrower per CRE: 96\nGK’s business performance vs peers:\nA. Higher GLP per CRE through customer retention\nThe table below summarizes the different productivity metrics of the MFIs as being considered important by the MFIs. As can be seen clearly GK has been able to manage a higher GLP per CRE through a higher outstanding per client, rather than the approach followed by other MFIs of pushing a higher case load per CRE to achieve a higher GLP per CRE.\nThis higher outstanding is being driven by higher customer retention, as higher retention enables GK to disburse higher loans, and as per my understanding of the industry, the retention rates are the highest in the industry (BFIL retention rate ~ 80%).\n\nB. Lower OCR through higher productivity\nAs MFI’s NIM on the JLG product is regulated by RBI, the critical metric that is tracked by the MFIs is the Operating Cost Ratio (Opex/Gross Loan Portfolio). With respect to OCR, GK has been able to establish industry leading standards of the lowest OCR of 5%. Refer the table below for the comparison of business performance of GK vs other MFIs along with the OCR performance.\nThe higher productivity combined with higher customer retention has enabled GK to maintain the industry leading OCR inspite of having one of the higher rural portfolio (which are characterized by longer distances, lower population density and lower customer loan ticket demands).\nGiven the situation in Assam, one might question if loans are being pushed by GK rather than becoming the largest lender to the customer by choice. The following metrics may be crucial to allay the concerns:\n• The MFIN guidelines of not providing more than 80K of loans to a customer, not lending to a customer who has loans from two MFIs and one Bank is applicable on NBFC-MFIs and not on banks, (eg. Bandhan Bank, now IndusInd with BFIL acquisition), therefore chances of over-lending to customers by GK is lower\n• GK’s ability to retain customers (through the product customisations mentioned earlier), enables it to increase the ticket size over period to customer’s who have a good repayment history (table repeated for reference)\nC. On-time repayments and NPAs\nNOTE: FY 17 spike is due to demonetization and FY 18 onwards spike is attributable to transition of the company to IND-AS from the earlier I-GAAP.\nEven with a faster growth in the overall portfolio the PAR number has grown slowly reflecting management’s ability to grow the loan book in a quality manner while not sacrificing on the growth either.\nRecent Performance:\nThe management has been conservative with respect to making provisions, while at the same time not sacrificing on the quality of the loan book\nD. ONE AREA WHERE GK LAGS Bandhan Bank: Customer vintage with GK vis-à-vis Bandhan Bank\nAs per Bandhan Bank’s management commentary [Bandhan taken as reference coz it’s the listed MFI with large exposure to the troubled state of Assam]\n“But first three cycles we are very conservative, our retention rate, dropout rate is high in first three cycles, so we are divided in that way. So, if I come to on that point, our 55% of the customer which is more than three cycle with us, and their average alone outstanding is Rs. 49,358 rupees, so those are with us. Average if you say that, out of 18 years 3 years, you divide 15 years, seven and eight years average these people are with us. But if I go to these the other customers who are not with a very much as the latest coming on that, and they are coming on that with 45%, their average is Rs. 29,000 rupees on that.“ Link\nVs. GK’s vintage composition of the customers\n\nHowever Bandhan’s Avg. Customer outstanding is 38,190 vs GK’s 32,000 reflecting 20% lower avg. outstanding, which may point (though a weak pointer, I admit) of GK not over-leveraging the customers.\n• Also, unlike other players which incentivises the last mile CREs for the case load, GLP and adherence to the processes (weightage differs from player to player), GK has delinked the incentive completely from the business performance of GLP and collections and have linked it to number of customers serviced and quality of service, thus potentially avoiding the situation of over-leveraging.\nE. Pan-India Presense:\nGK has followed the philosophy of expanding its business operations through contiguous districts, while avoiding the bad districts which have bad repayment history. The strategy has enabled GK to:\n• build deeper penetration in each of the respective state of operations, rather than just expanding every where,\n• contiguous expansion also provides the advantage of the CREs of not facing a major cultural or language change\nThrough this approach, GK has been able to expand into 230 districts in India, with presense in 13 states and one UT, through a network of ~930 branches.\nWhile GK has established presence in multiple states and districts, the business is primarily coming from the five states of Kar, Mah, Tamil Nadu, MP and Chg which is primarily driven due to vintage of operations in the states. As GK expands into multiple other states, the loan book is expected to further diversify.\nF. Higher Productive Employees vs Managerial employee:\nGK has been able to consistently increase its CRE headcount, which has provided it with the following advantages:\nCREs are lower cost employees, therefore higher the % lower is the avg. employee costs\nCREs are the resources which sources business for all the MFIs, and therefore higher the number reflects higher revenue possibilities\nFrom the table below, it can be seen that there is a very strong co-relation between the CRE headcount to the overall employee level OCR for the MFIs.\nIn order to realize such a larger % of CRE headcount, the operating model for a branch has been analysed to understand what provides GK the ability to support such a large employee base with limited managerial headcount (text in italics is the R&R of the people in the respective roles).\n\nThrough investments in process optimization, removal of inefficiencies, technology (has Temenos 24 as the core banking system for loan management), centralization, GK has been able to make its CREs more productive and removed the administrative activities from the managerial personnel R&R thus making them also more productive.\nExtract from management commentary:\n*“*Regional Processing Centers help to improve controls in the following manner:\n1) Check data entry of newly enrolled customers;\n2) Improve and maintain integrity in data quality;\n3) Independent data entry of new customers;\n4) Ensure complete and proper documentation”\n“Our Regional Processing Centers have not only improved our operational efficiencies allowing our field staff to focus more on actual business workstreams but have also significantly improved the data quality of our Customers’ information.”\nManagement:\na) MD & CEO: Udaya Kumar Hebbar is the MD & CEO of the Company.

The transaction therefore helps both GK and Madura as GK gets access to the high vintage customer of Madura, get presence into the states where GK has recently entered and the branch infra doubles up in Orissa and Bihar (which are one of the fastest growing MFI states), gets 2X additional branch infra in TN (which is considered one of the good states for MFI business)\nThe asset is operating at similar RoA levels as GK, therefore merger is not of a distressed business (my hypothesis is that financial services business is where distress acquisition should not be done)\nNNPA are 0% therefore the bad loans have been provisioned for\nSimilar and other benefits of the transaction has been mentioned by the management in the presentation\nStrength of business: Refer sections 3,4,5 for strengths in product, operations and costs efficiencies\nWeakness/Challenges of business:\nUnsecured loan portfolio by design and regulatory requirements\nBank’s trying to encroach into the traditional MFI customer segments/areas\nMerger of Madura Microfinance, till now GK has grown its business organically, and this is their first inorganic acquisition, ability to merge the culture, align/streamline processes will be critical\nCOVID’s impact on the MFI business leading to disruption in collections and new customer acquisition\nStock Valuation and Performance:\nFollowing is the stock chart of CAG, up until the market crash, CAG has been trading at a steep valuation, supported by superior business performance and lower NPAs, however post the market crash is it trading at price similar to mid 2019.\nWhile I have been able to analyse the business performance, I am not able to comment on the price of the stock if its trading at an attractive valuation or not, since I am generally poor in valuing stocks but consider myself decent with respect to analyzing a business.\nViews, Comments and Questions with regards to the analysis invited.\nSources: DRHP, Investor Presentations, MFIN, Annual Reports of the MFIs\nDisclosures: Bought 250 shares @ price of 800, bought during the market crash','Mar 22, 2020 2:14 pm'),(317,287,111,'Thank you for sharing your detailed work on CAGL and MFI industry Divyansh, your research covers almost all aspects of the business.

Next year/when the Corona situation improves dsda demand should return(not at 16 USD though) and phenol will return to being a cash cow soon enough again too… In the mean time IPA returns will cover this. Basic chemicals margins have improved and demand isn’t badly affected but it’s not a growth driver. However, what I’m happy about is the company knows all this… right now they are concentrating on specialty chemicals (agro and pharma) where margins and demand is increasing… they’ve also almost completed brownfield expansions in the same and their R&D has doubled too hence FSC contribution will only increase from now on. IPA is another example of how the management are capable to adjusting to short term opportunities and the numbers here will make up for the lower demand and margins in phenolics this year. What I see is a company moving seriously into fine and specialty chemicals as a growth driver , with basic chemicals as a predictable safe base, performance products as a wildcard which will average out to a decent return on average over a span of time and a phenolics venture that can return huge returns in both short(IPA) and long term post forward integration. I for one have been waiting for more concentration on FSC and I’m glad the management are doing the same.

The increase in Price rise post commissioning of Deepak Phenolics was mainly due to DSDA and OBA.

I’d hoped my post above would clarify this but il go into more details and il even use the management quotes from their concalls and AGM for the same in a paraphrased manner:\nPlease read the investor presentation. Management mentioned that due to lockdown they missed about a months worth of revenue. They also mentioned that the paper and textile industry was hit badly due to the lockdown. There was low demand for Phenol domestically too due to the lockdown. Now even, with all these issues their revenue for this month was just 33 percent lower than normal. With oba/dsda/phenol in so less demand this quarter should have been a washout but it wasnt. You have to ask why was that? And then check what they’ve told us\nPhenol demand domestically was less due to lockdown. So they began exporting it to recovering countries in Asia and Europe. They have the capacity to continue doing this even when the domestic market recovers due to all their capex.IPA and Acetone had high demand domestically and this will not stop anytime soon and now IPA will have double capacity soon. If demand slows down\nit means covid has gone …which means oba and dsda is back… so win win. They had issues exporting last quarter due to the lockdown but those issues are gone now.\nGrowth in Specialty chemicals was 20+ percent. Since it deals in pharma and agro chem this Will continue to increase for some time. Management has almost completed brownfield expansion for the same and even finished debotttling agrochem and will complete a powerplant for the same this year. They also mentioned that they will choose capex based on people’s needs and those are veering towards life sciences instead of infra. R&D has increased too…based on what the management is saying regards FSC expect it to be for this segment. So this will be a huge growth driver. Look at the margins in specialty chemicals and look at the PE of specialty chemical companies.\nBasic chem margins improved and results were surprisingly flat even with a lockdown. So there’s no major surprises expected here in either direction.\nOverall, when investing in a company like Deepak nitrite expect commodity based cycles… but look at how management plugs in the gaps in a down cycle to ensure that the results don’t fall off a cliff and infact still stay stable. IPA, FSC and Phenol exports will carry Deepak through this year . The textile and paper industry will slowly come back and so will domestic demand. Now imagine Deepak nitrite in a few quarters when the upcycle returns with a FSC segment contributing a huge chunk to revenue and PAT, Phenol with high demand in both India and abroad(+forward integration at some point), paper and textile industry fully functioning for dasda and oba to be back in fashion and basic chemicals offering a safe revenue stream.\nNote: I could be wrong about all this too and I am not a SEBI advisor.

Let me take a few instances which made me feel confident about the company:\nIn FY14, the management guided that for FWA, plant will take around 3 years to reach full utilization levels and breakeven and the management went on with the loss-making entity, turned it around completely in FY19 (yes, there was a delay) but to me, it shows that the management is capable of seeing the bigger picture and taking bold decisions.\nAnd as luck would have it, FY20 was driven by PP (Performance Products)\nIn the annual report of 2016, they mentioned that in the long run, the Phenol and Acetone plants would be used for speciality chemicals and they seem to have executed this starting from Q1FY21 (with an opportunistic bet on IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol), which is in huge demand because of its use in sanitizers and also as a solvent in pharma industry)\nIn Dec’16, they said they expect to grow the specialty chem business at 15% CAGR for next 5 years and the results are not bad (12-13% till 2020). I wouldn’t necessarily cut their points for missing this target\nI believe the management knows what they’re doing, have skin in the game, capitalizing on every opportunity they get and this decade is going to be a super interesting one\nHaving studied Vinati Organics before this, I find the management of Deepak Nitrite to be super-hungry (huge debt for expansion in Deepak Nitrite vs no-debt Vinati Organics), this does come with downside risks obviously\nOne thing which investors are betting on for Deepak Nitrite, except the whole transformation of chemical industry from West to East and the China Effect is the transformation from a commodity chemicals company to specialty chemicals company and a hopeful P/E re-rating\nI was quite curious about the sources of future growth for DNL, so decided to dig a bit further:\nPhenolics\nExample 1: Isopropyl Alcohol (already started)\nRaw Material required - Acetone\nDeepak Nitrite recently setup a 30K MTPA plant and is doubling the capacity by Q3 FY21, so even if we normalize the current super-high price realization of IPA, it should be able to capture a decent % of demand as ‘import substitute’\nFrom Acetone to IPA, what is heartening to see is that the company is moving towards value-added products and is competing in a big market (emphasis on change in realizations in the below table, although the increase in value added will not be equal to the exact difference of realizations, my point is that the company is ‘doing more of what it does’)\n→\n(Acetone Imports to India ) on the left and (Isopropyl Alcohol Imports to India) on the right\n(Acetone imports link https://phreakonomics.in/export-import/micro-individual?startDate=2015-08-01&endDate=2020-08-01&currency=inr&hscode_commodity=1639&type=imports&consolidation=fy 8)\n(IPA imports link https://phreakonomics.in/export-import/micro-individual?startDate=2015-08-01&endDate=2020-08-01&currency=inr&hscode_commodity=1542&type=imports&consolidation=fy 4)\nA huge opportunity which DNL has with Phenolics, is to go downstream with more value added products\nThe below 2 examples were mentioned in their annual reports (as well as on their website) as potential products, so I just wanted to know more about them in case they decide to go ahead with this)\nExample 2: Bisphenol A\nRaw Material Required- Acetone, Phenol\nMajor Use cases include making polycarbonates (a hard, clear plastic) and epoxy resins\nAccording to 2018 Annual Report, the local demand for BPA was ~80K MTPA and similar figure can also be obtained from the table below:\n(BPA imports link https://phreakonomics.in/export-import/micro-individual?startDate=2015-08-01&endDate=2020-08-01&currency=inr&hscode_commodity=9520&type=imports&consolidation=fy 3)\nThe good part seems to be Value-Addition + Big Market\n(More about BPA here https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/bisphenol-a-market)\nExample 3: Methyl Isobutyl Ketone (MIBK)\nRM- Acetone\nMajor Use cases are as solvent for manufacturing paints, as chemical intermediates and also used in semiconductor industry\nAccording to Annual Report 2018, the local demand for MIBK was ~28K MTPA and as can also be seen from the data below, this also presents a good opportunity for the company (not as big as BPA or IPA but still)\n(MIBK imports link https://phreakonomics.in/export-import/micro-individual?startDate=2015-08-01&endDate=2020-08-01&currency=inr&hscode_commodity=1641&type=imports&consolidation=fy 5)\n*Another potential product from their website which caught my eye was Polycarbonate, which again has Bisphenol A as its raw material (Now I might be getting carried away when Deepak has not even started with Bisphenol A )\nThis product also has a huge market size and is imported in vast quantities in India (also it seems like GAIL is interested in the space too https://www.chemanalyst.com/industry-report/india-polycarbonate-market-76 1)\n(Source for all the above data is phreakonomics.in)\nFSC\nWhile FSC has pretty good EBIT margins (20-25%) and revenue growth has also been in the range of 12-13% CAGR for the past 5 years.\nWhat I am unable to decipher is how much more revenue/what growth rate can be expected from this segment in the next few years and from where? (Since FSC caters to pharma and agrochem, both of which have tailwinds as of now, is there any visibility in terms of numbers?)\nThis segment seems a bit opaque to me and I do not understand this fully. If anyone can elaborate more on this, I’d be really thankful\nPerformance Products\na) DASDA\nb) OBA\nVertical Integration:\nToluene -> PNT -> DASDA -> OBA\nTrying to understand the market size,\nAnant:\nThe worldwide DSD market is around 64000 TPA\nAnant:\nThe increase in price is almost 3 fold from around 4000$/ton to 12000$/ton\nThis gives us a rough estimate of DASDA global market~250M USD , out of which Deepak Nitrite has ~12.5% as mentioned. Deepak also has a majority market share in India.\nWhat does the future look like in this segment? Exports?

Regards your question regards FSC here is most of what I know\nTheir main products were xylidine, cumidine, nitro xylene, oximes and their main plant was in Roha. Their margins improved over the past few years due to backward integration\nOnce covid began however they began increasing their releases in fsc: https://www.godeepak.com/catalog/26-xylidine/# 9.\nThey’ve mentioned R&D has doubled. I suspect the reason for r&d were these FSC releases\nThey cater to agrochemicals and pharma and wood preservatives. 2 of those sectors have huge tailwinds. So imo it looks like FSC is getting fast tracked. They’ve increased capacity via brownfield extension and.mentioned debotttling of agrochemicals+ addition of power plant. I’d assume right now the reasons are to cater to increased demand and also to increase margins. Management also said they may be concentrating on lifesciences for capex ie depending on where the demand is. I suspect once they have a clear idea of where their capex will be directed we ll know more too.\nYou are right though. That’s all I’ve found regards FSC. It’s easier to understand their other products so I need more help understanding these especially since I have no chemistry background. However, the “signals” ie R&D, capex, better margins, increased growth, new products, increasing revenue contribution all point to management planning something big regards FSC.

In this regard we will have to keep in mind from a long term perspective that IPA segment was making loss for Deepak Fertiliser before COVID. The demand for IPA for Pharma industry is almost at the same level during COVID period ,however demand of IPA for sanitiser peaked at 24000 TPA (in India from 2000 TPA as per DFPCL concall) and is now at around 12000 TPA, Against this incremental demand of 10000 TPA (12000TPA -2000 TPA) we have supply coming of 60000 TPA. Although at India level the demnd is around 200000 TPA against supply of 134000 TPA( DFPCL 74000 + 60000 Deepak Nitrite). As per my observation IPA supply was in surplus becasue of which DFPCL IPA segment made losses in pre COVID, however there may be structural changes in COVID and Post Covid which may significantly increase the demand of IPA. One more point is that IPA diverted for sanitisation is only a fraction of over all IPA production. Apart from this Ethanol can also be diverted for making sanitiser. It would be helpful if any of the boarder could throw some light on the long term demand scenario for IPA.\nFurther we also need to analyse the CAPEX required for downstream products like Bisphenol A (and then Polycarbonate),Methyl Isobutyl Ketone. Further is any special technical capability required and whether Deepak Nitrite posses that technical capability and if they have then why they did CAPEX for Phenol and Acetone and not for Bisphenol A (and then Polycarbonate),Methyl Isobutyl Ketone which are supposed to high margin product (as Phenol and Acetone were available without any constraints). As both Phenol/Acetone and its downstream derivatives would have been import substitution , would it had not been advisable for the company to go for high margin down stream derivatives products directly as a better capital allocation.\nMy questions would look basic and repetitive but it helps me as the response which I get are very informative .

What is the size or is this the first order in US and couple of details about it?\nShishir Joshipura (CEO PRAJ INDUSTRIES): It is not the first order for us in US. We have built several plants in United States but as I\nwas mentioning that the pandemic has given a new found rise to the requirement of\nPharma grade alcohol. So if you earlier looked at the alcohol market, we were looking at\nfuel ethanol which was one largest segment followed by potable alcohol which is a\ndrinking part of it and then third there was a small section of industrial alcohol but now\nPharma grade alcohol has walked in as third largest segment in my opinion, in our\nunderstanding. So this is creating a big demand so that’s first positive development in the\nmarket. Catching on that, one of the leading producers of ethanol in United States wanted\nto set up this facility at their Wisconsin plant to produce Pharma grade alcohol and Praj\nhas a technology which is absolutely unparalleled in terms of its efficiency and its output\ncharacteristics. So different markets in the world have different requirements, different\nspecifications for Pharma grade alcohol. United States happens to be the toughest and this\nis where our technology won head over heels for everybody else and we are building this\nfacility for them now. The current capacity, the plant that we are building is 50 kilo tonnes\nper annum.\nHaresh Hindocha: So what must be the, our part of the project cost in that particular order roughly?\nShishir Joshipura: It’s roughly about Rs. 50 crore contract for us.\nHaresh Hindocha: And what is the execution time?\nShishir Joshipura: As I was mentioning that people who are putting up Pharma grade alcohols, they want everything yesterday.\nHaresh Hindocha: I know, the big boom in Pharma sector, that’s why I am asking you.\nShishir Joshipura: A big push in demand and so we are contracted to supply this plant towards end of this year, calendar year.\nHaresh Hindocha: What is the situation in India in the Pharma industry? Are you getting the same responseCfrom the Indian Pharma sector?\nShishir Joshipura: The Indian Pharma grade alcohol, specifications are different.\nHaresh Hindocha: Then also what is the response in that sector, I mean domestic sector?\nShishir Joshipura: Two things, probably I can mention here that if you were to talk to my friends in the\nethanol producer, the sugar companies that are producing ethanol today; they will tell you\nthat this boom in sanitizer application has actually helped them realize better margins in\ntheir businesses because they are able to divert part of their production, for the\nproduction of hand sanitizer etc. So as I was mentioning there are different requirements\nin each market for different applications but in the toughest market in the world which is\nUnited States our technology has stood clearly differentiated compared to our\ncompetition.\nMy opinion:\nApart from IPA manufacturers sanitiser buisness is being looked by other industries also, so we do not know how long the high margins will continue in this segment.','Aug 28, 2020 9:07 am'),(345,288,106,'As far as Indian Market is concerned, Sanitiser Pricing is controlled by the Government.','Aug 30, 2020 12:58 pm'),(346,288,117,'businesstoday.in 29\nGovt removes face masks, hand sanitisers from essential commodities list 29\nThe government added face masks and hand sanitisers in the list of essential commodities after widespread shortage was reported from across the country in March, when COVID-19 cases started to build up in the country','Aug 30, 2020 3:07 pm'),(347,288,125,'Hi,\nI have NOT read/bought the report.

I’d just like to add a few additional notes from the concall. This concall highlighted the confidence in the management regards the business model and the total lack of understanding of the “analysts” regards the business model who almost embarassed themselves with the questions asked. However, the management turned those questions into a treasure trove of info for anyone interested in understanding the business model. I will try and avoid any overlap in the brilliant summary of the concall above so will avoid talking about debt/profit etc from the concall\nBasic chemicals:\nManagement outright said the investor community has misunderstood this term basic. Behind the scenes there’s a lot of work done juggling their products and they cater to a lot of sectors to de risk. For eg dyes, intermediates etc have had low demand but it was made up elsewhere. Basically, If one sector goes down the other comes up to make up for demand and this will always be the case. Also, a lot of downstream products can be made and hence they are automatically decreasing operational costs downsteam vs competitors.\nSpec chem:\nAgro and pharma has seen huge demand. They have a small number of clients but medium term visibility is good here and they are adjusting accordingly.\nPerformance products: the right margins here are 18 to 20 percent on average. There will be boom and bust periods but these are the average margins expected in the long run. Before deepak nitrite makes any decisions regards a new product they always check If they can still make money even when raw material cost is the highest possible and when prices are the lowest and only then they go ahead with it. This is playing out right now with performance products. Even in the current worst case scenario of contracts under low prices they are managing a profit(however small)\nPhenolics:\nAgain, it’s just genius juggling here. IPA took up most of the demand first 2 quarters. Since then they slowed down ipa and pushed towards phenol and acetone. They can produce about 1100 tonnes per day(700 phenol and 400 acetone) and as long as they can manufacture it they can sell it either in India or abroad depending on demand. There are big downsteam plans for these too in the future. Capacity utilisation at 115 percent on average vs 90 percent from last year.\nCapex:\n300 crores capex planned but they can’t commit to dates since they care about their employees and the labour and covid may delay this since construction may slow down since health and safety is their primary concern. This could be a short term issue but they know and understand it and are keeping their eyes on the long term. Their capex is based only on the factors mentioned above(ie deepaks right to win) and is based on a lot of complex factors that management plans brilliantly.\nChina +1: They basically outright said that this is just mumbo jumbo that analysyts come up with and they don’t look at. Demand for chemicals has been up since a decade and is not because of anything in the last 1 year and even if it is they don’t make plans on short term trends. They had some interesting things to say regards aatmanirbhar too regards how our aim should be to be a global supplier and not just national and how they exhibit this with phenol.\nIn short, the usual parameters that analysts track ie sustainability of margins/growth plans(no guidance given. They ll just continue growing wherever they see opportunity. This underpromising and confidence is refreshing) etc just wont work here. One needs to bet on the jockeys and expect a few short term hiccups but a steady growing long term vision.\nOn a personal note: Of all the companies I’ve studied and tracked I’ve never seen a more genius management at tackling uncertainty and cycles using understanding of their domain(process chemistry) and pure understanding of demand and supply of their products and de risking of their business model which removes all those worries from the mind of the investor(I personally will stop tracking prices of phenol/dasda etc from now on)\nDeepak Nitrite Earnings Call for Q4FY21\nDisc: invested since lower levels. 25 percent of my portfolio… no transactions in the last 8 months.

But they are not venturing into products with short term benefits (due to price hikes) they are looking for products with sustainable margins and a short payback period. The Management execution capabilities are such that after selecting the product (through Deepaks right to win which is the Decision making process for Management) they not only execute they also develop MOAT along the way either through process innovation (Like running the plant at 115 percent utilization) or by developing expertise in chemical processes or in supply chain.

I had done a store visit of Acrysil two weeks back on insistence of my good friend Ravjeet. Here is a quick summary about the visit:\nI had visited Acrysil Ltd’s exclusive showroom on October 16 at Ahmedabad in the evening around 7 - 7:15. And guess what, I was able to meet the Company Secretary who had his office just above the store. However, I wasn’t prepared for the meeting as it was just a store visit to check out the company’s products (I am yet to go through its AR’s and dig deeper).\nFirst of all, a quick word about the store. The store displayed quartz sinks, steel sinks, kitchen faucets, chimneys and gas stoves. A quick look at the product and one could see that the company manufactures/trades premium quality products. The smallest quartz/steel sink was priced at around 5200/-. The bigger sinks were all priced more than 10000/-. Surprisingly, the price of quartz and steel sink was almost similar. Also, the faucets were quite stylish and were pretty costly costing more than 10,000/-. The chimneys and stoves also looked pretty good. The company manufactures only quartz and steel sinks while it imports faucets, stoves and chimneys (stoves and chimneys from Germany [forgot to ask them about faucets]). However, I was the only customer in the store. But I was pretty impressed with the products.\nNow coming to the meeting with the CS. He was pretty forthcoming and was ready to share information about the company. He has been associated with the company for the past 4 years. He said that year ago the company had faced issues and was on verge of going into BIFR. However, the performance of the company has improved significantly over the past few years. The chimneys and stoves contribute just 2 - 3 % of company’s total sales as it has been just 1 year since it started selling them. Steel sinks contribute 20% to company’s total sinks sales while 80% is contributed from exports. Exports constitute 80% of company’s total sales and it exports to US, UK, Germany, France and other countries. The company doesn’t have any marble/quartz mines. The company has installed capacity of 3.25 lakh units per annum and is currently operating around 80% of its capacity. The company will not gain much from rupee depreciation as it also imports some of its raw material. I wasn’t much prepared for the meeting and told him that we will have a detailed discussion later.\nWe can actually dig deep in to the company and gather information about it. We can initially meet the CS (most probably after Diwali) and get our queries answered. In case we are satisfied with the answers, we can visit their Bhavnagar plant and get more clarity about the business and the company.\nRegards,\nAnkit','Oct 31, 2013 11:14 pm'),(385,290,151,'Launch of berbel by acysil.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0YGstb-ToA 75\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKsfvf87lE 40\nAs you know Germany is the heart of engineering, there is a company which is endeavouring to make world’s best range hoods and smoke/cooking vapour extractors\nhttp://www.berbel.de/ 26\nAcrysilhas got rights to sell their appliances in India too\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2h8XrHvxe4 48\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjXXENmx7vE 28\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGf7jF-9pp8 32\nregards','Nov 1, 2013 3:20 pm'),(386,290,152,'Tirumal, thanks for sharing the videos.

So looks like winner takes it all.\nOpportunity size is pegged in company AR at 1 crore granite sinks/year and company has paltry 1.8 L granite sinks in FY13, market share of around 1.8% of world.\nGrowth rate of segment domestically will be high which will be catered by Acrysil and internationally Acrysil can benefit by snatching market share from smaller players or penetrating into top 3’s pie. The growth in domestic market of both stainless steel and granite sinks look sustainable, a little hard to predict their international business.\nAverage realisation per sink was low around 4000 Rs for FY13, this seems contradictory to observations by Ankit where he mentioned the cheapest being 5200 Rs and are much higher for export segment. This is one place where numbers don’t add up. Even stainless steel are more expensive than 4000 Rs. There may be some dealer commission which might reflect in here but still realisation is too low and has led to margin being surprisingly low in a premium segment. This is one point on which we can question the company representative.\nCompany has mentioned capacity of 2,75,000 granite sinks and as mentioned by Company secretary total capacity is of 3,25,000 sinks. My guess is the rest 50,000 units might be of stainless steel sink produced by Acrysil steel.\nUtilisation rate of 80% might make sense if we consider companies performance in FY14.\nOn a utilisation rate of 80% on 3,25,000 units, and average realisation of ~4047 Rs/sink (9% stainless sink and 91% granite), we get yearly revenue of around 105 cr and half year revenue of 52.5 crore which is close to actual figure of 52.39 crore.\nEven if we consider the total capacity to be 2,75,000 and utilisation rate to be 80%, it will give higher realisation around 4870 Rs (at 52.5 crore half year revenue) which may explain higher margins of the company in Q1 and Q2 FY14. We need to confirm the actual capacity for both the segments which will give us better picture.\nFor Company to have 1000 Cr of revenue by 2020, it will have to increase its market share to around 15%, which looks possible due to lack of competition in Asian market. But the capacity required to produce such results would also be around 20 lac units. So capacity addition at brisk pace need to continue for that.\nAs Raj mentioned, company is constantly reinvesting to create more fixed assets, which I can attribute to reaching higher capacity in the futures and management aggression. They might be committed to 1000 Cr sales by FY20, which may have led to unoptimal usage of existing capacity before committing for further capacities.

He believes that companies that aim for global scale rather than merely import substitution will be sustainable winners. A key advantage India has versus other countries is the size of its domestic market, which helps Indian companies build scale and hence competitiveness.\n• Growth projects to be announced in coming months: While DNL’s management has not yet received approval from the Board to announce specific growth projects, this should happen within the next 3-4 months, upon which the company will make formal announcements. DNL has multi-product and multi-process plans for growth, which will be executed over the next few years. Mr. Mehta has previously said that the company has aggressive internal targets for growth, but has refrained from sharing specifics.\n• Key success factors: Highlighting the reasons for DNL’s successful track record over the past 50 years, Mr. Mehta pointed to the company’s financial prudence, strong execution skills across hazardous operations, and operational excellence initiatives. Additionally, he said that the last 5-7 years have also brought significant tailwinds for the overall chemical industry.\n• Differentiation vs. other specialty chemical companies: Compared to other leading peers in the Indian specialty chemical industry, DNL’s value proposition to customers is somewhat different, in that the company is typically vertically integrated across all its products, which makes it a more sustainable supplier compared to most others, while also giving rise to better resilience in margins. Additionally, the company takes efforts to cater to bespoke requests of customers for product customization.\n• Key focus areas as new CEO: Mr. Mehta said ‘Depend on Deepak’ is a key initiative he is focused on deploying: encompassing how DNL fulfills the needs of three key constituencies – employees, customers and investors. For employees, the company aims to become a great place to work and grow; for customers, one that offers cost excellence, product development and adherence to customer values (e.g., on environment, health & safety); and for investors, a company that offers a clear growth strategy, financial prudence and transparent communication. Another focus area is to judiciously add new competencies and products.

It is extremely difficult.\nThere can be 2 scenarios playing out in the next 3 years:\nScenario 1 can be all good\nAt the current juncture transpek is more or less doing sales of around 2X the gross block. They are adding capacity in Vizag with a capex of 120cr.\nAssuming this new capacity comes online in 3 years and starts to do sales of roughly 300cr (2.5X investment), and also assuming no more growth from current plants, one can come to sales of 570+300= 870cr. Lets call it 850cr.\nNow transpek already has expanded its operating margins to 20 plus percent. It can expand further in a good scenario and go to 25 percent (highly unlikely).\nSo 3 years down the line in good scenario transpek has sales of 850cr and operating margins of 25%. That can translate to PAT of 125cr with 25% tax (other being depreciation and interest cost).\nRoughly 15 percent CAGR on PAT.\nMarkets can value this PAT at 20 times, 25 times, 30 times or 35 times depending on the story at that time. Who knows. But lets say 15 times.\nSo we come to a Market cap of 1900cr and share price of Rs. 3300 (at 30 times the share price would be Rs 6600, and that is possible too)\nNow in Scenario 2 all is bad\nNo growth and 1 times asset turn on the new capacity of 120cr.\nSo in that case we come to a Sales of 570+120= 690cr.\nIf we think all bad is going to happen, lets also assume operating margins to come down to 15%.\nIn that case the operating profit would be 103cr and PAT can be 50cr (25 percent tax rate, higher depreciation)\nMarkets also don’t like falling margins and can derate the PE multiples so it can go to a PE of 10 times or Price to sales of 1.\nSo in this scenario the Market cap can fall between 500cr to 700cr roughly (share price of 900 to 1200)\nAt this point I don’t know which scenario is going to play out.\nOne has to take small position and see which way things are going and built conviction as every quarter goes by.\nThere is a 40 percent downside and 500 percent upside.

This industry provide large scale employment to low skilled workers (unlike IT, Pharma) and has export potential. All are import for the govt to keep the incentives on in one form or the other.\nAll this has resulted in many entrepreneurs borrowing and setting textiles mills thinking that yarn being a commodity, all they have to do it to make it and take it to the market and it will be easy to sell unlike a consumer product where they have to build distribution networks and brands. Indeed receivables of many of these companies is low indicating they are able to sell their finished goods quickly and get paid.\nTrouble is, many entrepreneurs from time to time hae built capacities without any due diligence of demand supply outlook. This has resulted in occasional margin squeeze when factories are commissioned just when RM prices rose.\nCheap debt (due to interest subsidy) has resulted in bringing down the ROCE into single digit level.

After completing his CA exams he started Nitin Spinners at an initial investment of Rs 28.5 million with a capacity of 150 tons of yarn per month. In the initial phase Dinesh started with two open-end yarn spinning machines and was spinning coarse yarn below 10s count.\nHowever, the Nolkha family took care to ensure that their product portfolio did not clash with that at the LNJ Bhilwara Group, since Mr RL Nolkha at that time, was still working for the group. Which is the main reason that, although Bhilwara is renowned as a hub for manmade fibre textiles, Nitin Spinners turned to cotton as their main source of raw material for spinning export quality yarn.\nIn 1998, Dinesh decided to foray into ring spinning, which was the time when, Dinesh persuaded his father to quit his job and join the family textile business full time.\nIn 2000, the younger sibling – Nitin joined the business and also the first of the 14,000 ring spindles began operations. In 2002, they set up a fabric knitting plan and also kept on increasing ring spindles capacity.

I am trying to understand how sustainable is the current ROCE for the company. I believe ROCE (and not RoE) is the right metric, given the company has lot of debt. There are 3-4 broad question heads I have. These further have more questions… I am posting the same here. If others are interested in doing more work, then maybe we can collate all the questions and meet/call the management?\nCan the company improve its margins from here? To answer this questions we can look at probable heads which can give us some answers:\nRevenue contribution of Specialty yarns - Currently my understanding is that it’s pretty small… what can change this? Are they doing something here\nKnitted Fabrics I feel there are doing something interesting on the knitted fabric segment. This now contributes 20% of revenue, it grew by 70% YoY. During my interaction with the CFO, he mentioned that Knitted fabrics have 1-2% more margins as it is more value addition than yarns.\nCotton Cycle - How does cotton cycle affect them? I did a comparison of their gross margins and the cotton prices, I couldn’t really interpret too much as there were couple of years when there was no co-relation (FY12 & FY13). My rudimentary understanding says that low cotton prices would be better for them, as they can have some inventory gains if the prices go up. But need to understand more here\nExchange rate- Need to understand this given FY13 and FY14 were very good years, was it to do with forex? My prelim analysis says not much contribution from forex is not much (6 Crores in FY13 and 4 Crs in FY14) One peculiar thing though- the company includes forex gain/loss as part of their topline.\n-Competition- Perhaps the most important, need to understand what sort of competitive pressure do they face. An interesting point I noted was that their realizations on their yarns have been pretty good. It has increased at a CAGR of 10% We need to check it for others, but usually, as a thumb rule, anything in double digits should be good.\nCan the company improve its asset turns (working capita/Gross block turnover - capacity utilization)- Historical Data of Nitin- As per last 15 years data the peak asset turns was 1.5x in FY14. Currently asset turns at 1x so there is 50% improvement in the best case as per historical data… This could change if there is any change if business mix/bargaining power (WC)/productivity of machines etc. If we look at a long term view, company has successfully reduced its inventory days, which has improved from 4 months to about 2 months currently… Overall for asset turns , we can look at competitors to perhaps make an educated guess on what this industry typically has in terms of asset turns…\nHow much and when will the company need more debt to further chase growth? - What is the revenue potential of this capex that we have done? Historically they have been going for major capex in a span of every 5-6 years, when they think they will get to new capacity?\nSorry for the long post.

The company is slowly adding value added yarns - such as compact yarns to its product mix, but there is nothing big happening here as the market is niche and more specialized and thus growth won’t be massive\nFY13 & FY14 were great years for the cotton yarn market, and thus the margins are on the higher side in these two years.

My perspective on Nitin Spinners is that it is a company which is coming out of a mess into being a normal company. Ambika is a company which is moving from normal to a better value / managed company. Market seems to acknowledge that and that is the premium Ambika gets in its valuation over textile companies.\nNitin seems to be doing ok but there are other factors which is beyond. Last time Nitin did a capex, the financial crisis stuck and Nitin took a hit. Ambika was able to overcome the crisis because of its debt management. Again now Nitin has done a massive capex. If there is no major economic issues, it should do well. Ambika is better poised because of its low debt.\nI think this is a pure commodity play. If push becomes shove, the suppliers are going to squeeze your margins irrespective of the machines / quality of the products. The companies that have scale and prudent debt management are the ones that are going to survive. Having said that the market does not have huge expectations of Nitin but if Nitin can cut down debt and have a good dividend payout it may get re rated.\nTextile sector as such is not doing well due to high debt and other legacy issues. So ppl do not expect much of textile companies.\nEven though high debt is a problem with Nitin, it should be analyzed in detail. LT Debt is usually for Capex while ST debt is for working of the company. LT Debt usually are available at cheaper rates than ST Debt. LT Debts are planned while ST Debt are adhoc.\nTill last year Nitin had been reducing its ST debt considerably and also it is v less when compared to the LT Debt. Having a very small ST debt is only possible if you are able to bargain with your suppliers and your client. Ideally suppliers should be paid longer where as the money is collected quickly from clients. When you have a commodity product, clients will pay promptly only when they are satisfied. Proper client selection is also important. Only scale and payment as scheduled to suppliers will buy you time.\nFor 2014-15 both debts have shot up. This could be attributed to the heavy capex they have implemented.

Let us look more deeply and check how other companies like Ambika Cotton Mills survived and also what will happen if a scenario like 2007-2008 happens to Nitin\nThere were 2 periods when the company’s profit went down\nIn 2006 the company went in for a capex and funded it through IPO + debt. The global crisis hit in 2008 when the company implemented its capex. Subsequently the company got into CDR.\nIn 2011 the volatility of cotton prices along with the closure of dyeing units in Tirupur became a double whammy\nThe above two incidents were related to the sector. So let’s see if this corresponds to other companies in the sector. We will be comparing Nitin Spinners with ACML (Ambika Cotton Mills Limited) because ACML has been already vetted by Prof\nIt seems that ABCL also underwent the above 2 pain periods but they were able to sail through because they were making profits and the periods resulted in drop of profits. Whereas Nitin Spinners were making less profits + a capex and the 2008 period led them to make losses.\nSo what happens if a 2008 arises, Nitin will be definitely affected but hopefully the current cash flow will sail them through. The MD also found out to go over 2008 he needed to get into value added products like slub yarns and lycra yarns.\nHaving said that, Nitin Spinners has implemented a heavy capex in Feb 2015.

Hence total debt is again back to 350 odd crores.\n6- They plan to repay 30-35cr debt this year.\n7- They are already at 95% utilization even after new capex. Which means FY16 could potentially be a BIG YEAR for them.\n8- Promoters very well know this and hence they have bought a lot of shares from open market in March.\n9- The PE is ridiculously low and the growth runway is huge.\n10- I think the company will earn 60cr PAT in FY16 and if we assign a 10x multiple, the mkt cap should be 600cr which is 225cr now. Conservatively, it should see 80-90 levels.\n11- Management also said that they will not dilute and also no more capex will happen until next year.\n12- Their ROIC is decent at 26% post the massive capex recently.

Even after digging deeper, I could not find a few niche products that any typical B2B website would have. Amazon does have a B2B segment in India but that focuses only on finished goods corporations would need like IT Products, Stationery, Cleaning Materials, etc. The reason Indiamart is unique is because it is the only truly B2B marketplace in India where you can find every product a business requires. If you are a tyre manufacturer who needs a special chemical, Indiamart is the easiest way to find one. If you want bottle caps for your soft drink bottle, Indiamart is the place to find a manufacturer for it. You will struggle to find any other comparables which provide such a wide range of products. Alibaba in China is the most well known example outside India.\nThere is always a threat of a tech giant swooping into this market. Like you said, right now it would be too premature to assume that it can never happen. However, I do not see any such threat visible in the near term simply because this seems a whole different arena than the arena they are currently playing in. Amazon has spent years mastering consumer logistics. The logistics to deliver a phone and the logistics to deliver 10,000 bottle caps are completely different. There are too many niches in this segment and the unit economics would be incredibly difficult. This is the reason Indiamart too exited this model and focused on subscription model. I have not seen Amazon do anything similar in US or any other country. I would assume they would try this model in their home market first rather than directly in a country like India. Even if they ever do plan to start something, it would be more on the lines of what Udaan is doing(Finished goods) than what Indiamart does.\nSo Zee Marathi and Radio Mirchi have launched their own B2B websites? I have not come across them but in case they have, the threat would not be high. Indiamart’s moat in the their network benefits. It has an incredible first mover advantage and for anybody else to reach the number of listings and buyers would require years of marketing and advertising.\nIndiamart’s unique advantage is the wide variety of products available on its website. To a normal individual it is hard to fathom the number of raw materials to make a finished good. Around 200 raw materials are required just to make a tyre. It will be extremely difficult for a new entrant to replicate the sheer breadth of products.\nDisclosure - Invested and hence views might be biased.','Jun 19, 2020 11:29 pm'),(871,282,51,'and how do you know its in accumulation or distribution ?','Jun 19, 2020 11:29 pm'),(872,282,47,'On the chart, the current phase is a sideways.

What are your key revenue streams?\nAns. We create websites, microsites and catalogs. We do a complete turn key package – designing, hosting, offering higher listing on Indiamart, Search Engine Optimization. We submit the sites to various business directories. So this is a subscription package where you know the website designing and hosting portion has become a minuscle in terms of revenue. Most of the people come to Indiamart not to have a four page microsite designed for Rs. 25,000, but because they see that there is a value in listing that they get on Indiamart platform.\nQ. What kind of value adds are you offering on top of that?\nAns. On top of that there are pure advertising services which are more of a top listing, premium listing, banner advertising on a relevant category, special listing on product search. So these are value added products; We also have hundreds and thousands of micro product-specific portals for Apparels, Plastic, Chemicals etc. So we offer sectional sponsorship. We are slowly and slowly moving from a listing fee based model to a lead based model. Our initial model always contains a minimum commitment, where we gave a minimum guarantee – if you are spending Rs.25,000 with us please expet atleast 50 good enquiries in a year from the website. We’ve realized that some customers have matured enough to be able to go to pay per click or pay per lead model as well.\nQ. So how do you look at it going forward now?\nAns. We launched a buy lead section, a business prospect finder section, which is mostly for lead generation section. So is a mix of things – a cataloguing plus basic listing fee that comes under subscription revenue, pure listing fees which are on the top of basic listing fees that could be premium listing and payed listing and banner advertising. Then there is a pay per lead revenue. If you see then 5-6 years back 80-90% of our business was purely cataloguing and subscription revenue only 5-10% was pure listing fee and advertising fee. Today 60-70% is cataloguing revenue and about 30% comes from purely listing and premium listing fee …you know those are experienced Internet and Indiamart users, and going forward I think that pay per lead would also become a sizeable chunk of that.\nQ. From a listing based model, do you see yourself launching a marketplace like E-Lance and facilitate the entire transaction?\nAns. I don’t think that we can move to a transactional model in the immediate or medium term. , but if we take the basic concept where we can connect the buyers and sellers, without the money part – it’s the pay per lead model. That’s in the trade offer section at Indiamart.\nQ. What about auctions?\nAns. As I said, the price discovery does not happen, though we tried an auction model in late 1999. What happens is that B2B is slightly different than B2C – it’s not an off the shelf product, nobody wants an off the shelf product. Most of the people have their own sizing, colours, quality parameters and the deals are not in few thousand rupees but mostly in few Lac Rupees. Buyers and sellers have to talk 5-10 times before they can settle on a price. For example, if there’s an offer to buy 50,000 pairs of socks – there someone is going to make a pitch that I can offer you one variety in 30 days for 1$, another for $1.25 or this kind for $1.3 etc, depending on quality and size. So the price discovery would not take place on a B2B Market Exchange. But I can facilitate buyer and supplier discovery, and whether they do business depends on their requirements.\nQ. If you’re looking at a lead generation model, and your primary clients are the sellers – the number of leads would go down in a downturn…\nAns. Yes, but then at the same time the requirements for these leads would go up. Then the sellers who might not have been using the Internet previously but going around the world to trade fairs, would look at the possibility of using the Internet to sell their product. See the Internet finds you unknown buyers, unknown markets. We ourself as a company have discovered some market possibiities which which were strong on the internet.\nQ. Like what?\nAns. Like travel. We had never ever even focussed on travel being a B2B company. We might have made a few travel websites by chance and we found that those customers were more satisfied and at that point of time we started doing a lot of marketing on travel and a significant amount of revenue started coming from it. A little more later, in terms of service we discovered that packers and movers became hot. Engineering goods also started doing very well. So we keep discovering new categories where suppliers and buyers find each other. The Tnternet throws you unknown possiblities, just by trying it out. I am sure that in this kind of a downturn lot of suppliers would come to Internet to try out different things. That may not compensate fully for the total market loss that happened because of the downturn but it ened mup making a new market for us.\nQ. Talking about the competition, your success depends on the buyer base that you have. Won’t an Alibaba come in with a fairly large global database of buyers whereas you would come with a large database of sellers?\nAns. Alibaba comes in equally with a large number of suppliers from China – that is their strength and weakness both. Indian suppliers typically do not want to compete with Chinese suppliers, and they will have to do that on an Alibaba type of platform. The whole world has been looking at China as their supplier, which is why Alibaba has done so well. If the buyer preference changes, they will start logging on more to IndiaMart more because they know that AliBaba provides chinese suppliers.\nQ. But then it becomes important for Alibaba to market their services in India better to develop their supplier base. Then there’s going to be competition for you to get suppliers…\nAns. Obviously, and if you really see the market size is very large. It’s a trillion dollar trade opportunity. By the entry of Alibaba, the supplier base will be more educated – more competition is more market development. If you see the example of Naukri.com 1 and Monster both are existing together, and both are equally big. If you see China, it has an equally large player called Global Sources, Made in China, EC21 and there might be 200 smaller ones.\nQ. So what about TradeIndia 7 then?\nAns. I cannot comment on them. They are primarily a print company, while we are primarily an Internet company. See when I started I was only 1/10th of their size. Today we are probably 3 to 4 times their size. We have been consistently growing at a 50-60% rate and they must be growing at a slower rate. They must have their own set of market priorities and choices. Growth of anything below 40% is not acceptable for me, and I don’t know if in any of these years they would have achieved any of these minimum figures. So TradeIndia has always been a good follower of ours on the Internet.\n# IndiaMart CEO Dinesh Agarwal On Why The Upturn Made Him Raise Funds\nQ. How has the downturn impacted you?\nAns. I think the latter part of the upturn affected us more than the downturn. We were highly cashflow positive business, and towards the end of 2006-2007, there was market frenzy. Our costs were going up unnecessarily and the whole business model started to look non-feasible in the medium or the longer term. If costs were to grow at 30-40-50% growth, I didn’t see the businesses flourishing in the long run. That is when I decided to raise the money. We would never thought of raising money otherwise.\nQ. Your employee cost must have gone up significantly…\nAns. Yes, that and real estate cost went up significantly during the upturn. That was the initial feeler for me that if tomorrow some serious competition came in and spent a lot of money, we would be in a crunch situation. With the downturn, the market expectation in terms of costing will come down; it will impact our customers as well, which would indirectly impact our topline. But these are the times when Internet advertising grows.\nQ. How has the company been doing and how do you think the market will evolve?\nAns. IndiaMart has been a profitable company since day one. We have been growing consistently over the years, whether it was a downturn or not, within a range of anywhere between 30-40% to 65-70%. If you just compute the basic CAGR it is approximately 40-60% CAGR per year over many years. But those were times when our total revenue base itself was at a smaller size. I don’t think that many businesses were adept at using the Internet at a very large scale 4-5 years ago.\nIn the last 10 years, two things have happened – the Internet penetration and connectivity have become somewhat reliable and secondly, businesses have started responding to the opportunity on the Internet. The second generation has now started participating in the businesses, and an inflexion point is about to come in the Indian business Internet usage, the same way it did in China 8-10 years ago. Now I feel that at a large revenue base like ours, to maintain a growth of 40-60% over the next few years we might have to spend a larger amount of money on different activities like advertising and marketing, and a strong management team. We have not been advertising.\nQ. You have had feet on the ground…lots of people in sales…\nAns. That is true. But if you want to penetrate into slightly medium and larger SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), a brand pull has to be created. Because we want to consolidate our position as a strong leader, it is prudent to spend a good amount of money on the market initiatives – not just do sales. We have been very strong in sales with a thousand people strong team. We also think marketing will help us attract better talent.\nQ. Didn’t you sign up for BCCLs Private Treaties for the marketing?\nAns. Yes we did.\nQ. So why not continue with BCCL rather than going with Intel Capital?\nAns. Intel is probably going to complement it with money. BCCL has media properties, but for a larger market pull, you need to invest across various media…and you cannot do private treaty deals with 7 different media houses.\nQ. Did you have any issues with the valuations? From what we’re told, Times Private Treaties valued you rather high; So did Intel capital go for a down-round?\nAns. No it was not a down round; it was a slightly better round than that…but in terms of multiples we might have gone down because when we raised BCCL round it was at the height of 2006 and it was more of a barter deal, without cash infusions. The multiples are definitely lower this time, but we have grown to almost double our size since then, so the overall valuation is higher this time.\nQ. Where is the synergy with Intel Capital? You’re a B2B marketplace…\nAns. For me, they are more of a venture capital fund. I met different venture capital companies over the last two years. Intel matched better with us, they had a longer horizon, and are less impatient than some of the pure VC firms. Some of them think that you have to burn faster to run faster . Somehow my companys DNA does not match with that, we have been a slow, steadily growing company. We are not at that stage where we are a small company, and we not do need a day to day guidance. I mean, we have been able to grow sustainably to a thousand people team.\nQ. So where is the exit for Intel Capital?\nAns. I would say that IPO would be an exit for them, or an M&A possibility, but that is not going to be any time soon.\n# No Single Category Contributes More Than 10% To Our Revenues - IndiaMart CEO Dinesh Agarwal\nQ. What are your expansion plans?\nAns. There are 2-3 things: We have started to utilize our database of SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) to expand our offerings. We participate in almost 150 trade fairs across the world – half of them in India, half outside – and end up spending almost a million dollars per year on that. To strengthen our buyer relationships we came out with a sourcing guide or a buyers guide, which lists our clients, and has additional advertising for revenues. That also brings buyers back to IndiaMart.com 2 as a platform for updated information. Most of the big companies in our space have been print Yellow Pages initiatives that have gone to the Internet. For us, going to Print is a buyer acquisition strategy, and there can be other media like mobile and Interactive TV going forward.\nThe other is a geographical expansion – we cover about 60-100 cities from 25 offices across india, and we want to penetrate deeper and broader into Indian territories, going into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities as well. We might even look at international opportunities.\nQ. What is the kind of dependency do you have on specific categories?\nAns. Our dependency on any particular category is low. No single category contributes more than 10% to our revenues. That is the precise reason why we have been able to survive different types of market situations.\nQ. What is the range, in terms of the revenues, of the sellers in your platform?\nAns. Around 90% of them range from from Rs. 50 lakhs to Rs. 50 crores…probably 60% range from Rs. 1-10 crore range. Most of them are small and medium enterprises, with small scale companies having a larger share.\nQ. How do you see this mix evolving, as you increase marketing spends and roll out your expansion plans?\nAns. Two different things will happen – one is that obviously the small is going to have the larger share, but with our marketing spends, I see a slightly larger size of SMEs coming on board with us; these are normally late in adopting any kind of technology because of their corporative structures. We think middle and slightly larger SMEs will become the part of our database.\nOur entry level services start at Rs. 20-25,000, but there are lot of customers who pay us in excess of Rs. 1 or 2 lakhs per year. The growth would probably happen in all the segments parallely, but we expect that a larger chunk of medium sized enterprises will contribute higher revenue and a large number of small suppliers that would contribute to the data base.\nQ. Makes me wonder…how did you start out? How did you get your first client?\nAns. When we started out, we collected association directories, from Federation of Indian Exporters, Ph.D. Chambers of Commerce, CII and attended certain Trade Fairs…we collected the data and sent mails and bulk faxes to them. We started as a website making company, and the IndiaMart market place came much later – the marketplace was a by-product of the website making business. Because I was making businesses websites and I thought it would be a prudent to keep on making a directory of business websites.\nSo the first few clients that we attracted were primarily for website making. Nirula’s, one plastic wholesaler, one leather exporter were some of the first clients that we started with. I am proud to say today that Nirula’s is still with us after 12 years. We were the first ones that accepted credit cards on Nirula’s website in India. Theirs was a single page website and then we launched Nirulas.com 12. Others include Jindal steel, the Triveni group, and also some exporters.\nThe mix changed during 1998-99 when inbound travel and tourism took off. We were making websites for Indian Travel Agencies and Tour Operators, and much of our revenue at that time was from inbound tour operators in Delhi, as inbound tourism is concentrated around Delhi. I think it continued till September 11th, 2001, and after that once the travel market went down the drain. By then, our B2B marketplace was matured enough, and took a fast growth path. In 2006 we claimed 10,000 clients.\nQ. When talking to customers during the initial stages, what did you pitch to them?\nAns. We pitched to them a website and a business through the website – we always knew that Internet would be used to generate business through searching from AltaVista and Yahoo. There were very few Indian websites at that point of time – if you searched for a “Restaurant in Delhi”, Nirula’s website or “leather exporter in India”, our websites would show up high on search. But as more websites were created over the years in India, search engines began tracking more sites – newer and smaller websites. At the same time the market place caught on.\nToday the traffic mix for the websites we make is 60-70% through Indiamart.com 1 and 20-30% direct, while earlier it used to be 10-20% through Indiamart.com 1 and 80% direct. So over the years things have changed the market place has started gaining momentum and stickiness. But, from day one, we were commited to making business websites for the purpose of generating business, and not just for using it on a visiting card – whether directly through search, or indirectly through Indiamart.com 1.\nQ. You have also tried the B2C space – with the Indian Gifts Portal 12…\nAns. It was launched in 1999 as a subsidary company, but before the Intel Capital funding, we hived it off…de-subsidarized it. It remains in my ownership, and continues to grow at a 40-60% per annum though we are not marketing it actively.\nQ. What percentage of your revenue comes from ABC payments 10.\nAns. Maybe 3-4%, less than 5 for sure.\nQ. Did you try any other B2C initiatives? You tried Hotel Reservations…\nAns. We still do about 5% of the business from travel and we are in the process of launching another small travel lead aggregation business. We launched the hotel reservation business as a part of the travel business, but I think the time was not right in the year 2001. Our expertise was in the foreign inbound tourism space, and hotel reservation was an extension. Now there are many players in the travel space, and I don’t think we will ever go back into the hotel reservation or B2C travel.\nFINANCIALS\nKEY RISKS\nIf we are unable to maintain a critical mass of suppliers and buyers on our online marketplace, the perceived usefulness of our services may decline, and our business, revenue and prospects could suffer.\nCompetition from new and existing companies may reduce demand for our services or cause us to lose visitor traffic, market share or paying subscription suppliers, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to retain existing paying subscription suppliers on or attract new paying subscription suppliers to IndiaMART.\nWe earn most of our revenue from Indian suppliers purchasing paid services on IndiaMART.

Please find my findings below from Annual Reports, Conference Calls, DSIJ report put above and IPO Prospectus.\nIntroduction:\nIndiaMART is an e-commerce B2B marketplace started in late 1990s. It has tried various business models, pivoted with learnings and finally emerged as India’s leading B2B e-commerce marketplace with market share of 60%.\nThe company is going through a lot of tailwinds - Internet Penetration, GST, Tech adoption by SMEs, Network effect of Buyers and Sellers. And these tailwinds are expected to stay well for the foreseeable years. These tailwinds are causing the company to grow its business at tremendous rates with revenue growing at 25%+ CAGR over the past three years and profits growing at ~30%.\nAlso, there is a strong operating leverage coupled with this huge sales growth as the company recently turned profitable and unit economics are very strong. The CEO aspires to achieve EBITDA margins of Facebook / Naukri over the years, which are at 50%. He is looking at targets of 25%+ revenue growth and 20% growth in expenses over the next few years. Corporate tax cut would also help here, as they have enough pricing power.\nWell-scaled tech companies are cash-oozing machines. Once a tech company turns profitable, the incremental re-investment needed for incremental growth is very low and this characteristic of the business helps it to continuously ooze cash. Look at well run Silicon Valley companies for examples.\nThere is a lot of pressure on the Indian government to boost manufacturing activity in the country and create jobs. If this leads to increased business activity in the country, it would immensely benefit IndiaMART.\nIndiaMART is richly valued by the market at 65 times P/E and 11 times P/S. However, the strong sales growth coupled with operating leverage can give strong returns if things go well for the company.\nPackages:\nSilver (Rs 30k / year): Supplier storefront + Unique webpage with Personalized URL containing IndiaMART domain name + Access to online payment gateways + 7 RFQ credits per week + Product Listing Priority\nGold (Rs 30k to 60k / year): Silver Package benefits + TrustSEAL verification + 14 RFQ credits per week [OR] Silver package + Personalized URL without IndiaMART domain + 21 RFQ credits per week\nPlatinum: Gold++ (i.e. Higher Priority Listing, More RFQ Credits…)\nCustomers can buy also additional RFQ credits on top of these packages but these don’t contribute too much to the topline.\nOne can go through the solutions tab from below link for more details:\nIndiaMART – 19 Aug 14 2\nAbout Us 2\nIndiaMART is India’s largest online B2B marketplace, connecting buyers with suppliers. With 60% market share of the online B2B Classified space in India, the channel focuses on providing a platform…\nARPU as of Q2FY20: 45000 Rs\nTop 10% customers contribute 40% of the topline. ARPU of these customers is about Rs 1.6 lakhs.\nAnnual package subscribers typically churn at 20% per year => 2/3rd customer base.\nMonthly package subscribers typically churn at 5% per month => 1/3rd customer base.\nRenewal rate turns out to be significantly better as the customer becomes a turned one. So typically, you would see the first year renewals would be lesser as compared to the second year renewals and the third year renewals.\nCMS & LMS:\nIndiaMART has developed its Content Management Services (CMS) and Lead Management Services (LMS).\nThe CMS helps suppliers manage their product and service catalogues on IndiaMART while the LMS provides suppliers instant access to their IndiaMART business enquiries in one place online and the ability to manage them. The LMS also allows suppliers to arrange and respond to enquiries in one place. The CMS integrated in the mobile app allows suppliers to manage their listings and conduct business ‘on the go’. The mobile app also offers instant notifications of enquiries, RFQs and replies.\nSellers can also integrate their leads originating outside the IndiaMART platform on the LMS, which makes IndiaMART LMS as a single unique platform for managing their entire business leads. This also makes the supplier base sticky.\nPayments:\nPay With IndiaMART is in beta phase, using which the company is trying to build an additional revenue stream. It is a payment gateway that allows sellers to create a payment link and send it to a customer over Email, SMS etc. The payer can click on the link and make the payment using credit card, net banking and other payment options. IndiaMART charges the seller a transaction fee of 1.75% and applicable GST (currently 18%) on the transaction fee.\nThe company also offers 100% buyer protection, which covers buyers against various issues such as non-receipt of product, damage etc. Buyers can raise a claim for refund with IndiaMART.\nInitially, the company saw good traction but is finding it difficult to scale up on the payments side. They only do 5000 payment transactions per month and these are early days. The company is trying to tweak the payment product on a monthly basis to find the sweet spot at which they can scale very well.\nOther Potential Revenue Streams:\nCredit: The company seems very interested here as they have access to transaction data between the buyers and sellers. There are two ways to run a credit business in marketplaces.\nAct as a medium and let financial institutions lend to the suppliers while IndiaMART charges commission\nLend out of your own books by getting an NBFC license\nIndiaMART plans to go explore the first route as they believe building platforms using technology is their core competency than lending.\nSaaS: This can be an additional top-up to the SMEs on top of IndiaMART’s subscription package to help them manage their businesses well.\nInvestments: IndiaMART already started using its cash to fund new startups. It has recently invested in a startup called Vyapaar which helps the business in accounting, invoicing and inventory. IndiaMART wants to help this company grow over the next two years and then later consider fully merging it into IndiaMART.\nIndiaMART – 4 Sep 19 1\nIndiaMART leads Series A investment in Vyapar, a business accounting software... 1\nNoida, India, September 3rd, 2019: India’s largest online business-to-business marketplace IndiaMART announced its investment in Vyapar, a mobile-based business accounting software for small busine…\nUdaan:\nLots of startups have started focusing on SMEs like Power2SME, Moglix, IndustryBuying, Udaan, Bizongo, OfBusiness… Out of all these, Udaan has drawn heavy focus from the VCs. It commands a huge valuation of almost $3 billion, while IndiaMART is valued by Dalal Street at < $1 billion. Udaan is flush with cash of $500+ million, as of October 2019.\nThe Economic Times – 3 Oct 19\nUdaan valuation soars to $2.8 billion post $585 mn funding\nON THE FAST LANE: Firms rise to Unicorn status makes a compelling case for SME digital disruption.\nHowever, the operational business of Udaan is still small compared to IndiaMART and we need to see how they will expand and compete with IndiaMART. Udaan operates only in few verticals like apparel, electronics, pharmacy, staples, fresh food and FMCG products while IndiaMART’s main focus is on long-tail manufacturing products (Also no single category contributes more 10% of revenues of IndiaMART). Udaan is also into lending business and yes, it is lending from its own books. I think lending is not a very easy business to learn with speed even though you use cutting-edge tech, so we should check if their loan book growth would be a conservative one or an aggressive one. Another aspect of Udaan is they also handle the logistics between the supplier and the buyer, while IndiaMART doesn’t service the logistics but just connects the buyers and sellers. IndiaMART has already given a shot at logistics part through Tolexo.com 2 and observed that the unit economics there doesn’t make much sense and hence pulled it off.\nSuch huge focus / funding by VCs and entry by new startups in this area asserts the longevity of the industry.\nPromoters:\nThe promoters’ educational background doesn’t look very impressive, however his professional experience from the Wikipedia article gives confidence. But I think we can give low weightage to his education given the way he has built IndiaMART and pivoted it through his learnings.\nThe promoter doesn’t seem to like investors of the type “Burn fast to Run faster”. Look at the video below where he talks about it. It suggests he is building a business to run during his lifetime than to just sell and cash in.\nB2B e-commerce is tougher than B2C e-commerce: IndiaMart founder\nPromoter’s story in his words:\nIndiaMART – 2 Jan 20 6\nFrom Idea to IPO: How Growth Needs to Evolve at Every Stage | Entrepreneur India 6\nEntrepreneur India Here’s a gripping account by Dinesh Agarwal, Founder and CEO, IndiaMART, of how digitalization has changed MSMEs and how much more still needs to be done to adopt the techn…\nWill have to do some work on the promoter side, to have more confidence that the business is being by strong people.\nFinancial Metrics:\nBalance Sheet, P&L Statement and the Cashflow Statements can be looked up on Screener.in. Let me devote this space for even more interesting metrics.\n2019 2018 2017 2016\nSuppliers (millions) 5.5 4.7 3.2 2.3\nPaying suppliers (000s) 130 108 96 72\nProduct Listings (millions) 60.7 50.1 33 -\nBuyers (millions) 82.7 59.8 39.4 27.1\nVisits (millions) 723.5 553 326 262\nEnquiries (millions) 448.9 290 157 115\nProduct Listings / Suppliers 11.03636364 10.65957447 10.3125 -\nVisits / Buyers 8.748488513 9.247491639 8.274111675 9.667896679\nEnquiries / Buyers 5.428053204 4.849498328 3.984771574 4.243542435\nEnquiries / Visits 0.6204561161 0.5244122966 0.481595092 0.4389312977\nPaying suppliers % 0.02363636364 0.0229787234 0.03 0.03130434783\nCalculated ARPU 39032.07692 38010 33100.3125 34132.36111\nBuyers => Growing at a tremendous rate - 3x in 3 years. And the number of enquiries per buyer has also risen from 4.2 to 5.4.\nSuppliers => Also growing at a fast rate - 2.5x in 3 years. And the number of product listings per supplier has also risen from 10.3 to 11.\nOnly bad part among those metrics is that the proportion of paying suppliers is falling and I hope to see it increasing too. However, the ARPU is increasing very well over the years, implying customers are really seeing value in their subscriptions and upgrading their subscription package.\nDue to upfront payments for the subscriptions, the company is working capital negative of 1 month. This helps the company stay flush with cash and helps it react quickly whenever an opportunity surfaces.\n2019 2018 2017 2016\nInventory days 0 0 0 0\nReceivable days 0.3800495634 0.5769965031 0.5838926781 0.3504456016\nPayable days 29.9533634 35.59872976 33.25219319 54.72622496\nIndiaMART has this concept of “Deferred Revenue”. When suppliers buy package for the full year or for couple of upcoming years, you already have the cash in your accounts but the revenue is recognized only when that time period passes. All the remaining cash will be accounted as “Deferred Revenue”. Typically, 60% of Deferred Revenue represents contracts for the next 12 months and remaining 40% represents for time period post next 12 months.\nRisks:\nDisruption => With VCs shifting focus to B2B now and they are very aggressive and happy to see red P&L statements, we should see how IndiaMART will face this competition while maintaining profitability.\nFake suppliers => Listing of fake products by the suppliers can cause trust issues in the marketplace. The company has turned very stringent while approving suppliers. It is looking for suppliers with 100% verification of mobile numbers and also registering suppliers who have their GST registration completed.\nHacking / Security => Leaked information of customers can lead the company to a huge trouble.\nAdvertising Costs => IndiaMART had incurred losses few years back when they were bang on in advertising. As of now, they have stopped advertising. P&L statement can take a hit again if they have to go aggressive on advertising again in the future.\nDifferential Pricing => IndiaMART prices SMEs the same across categories, industries, towns and cities. This can cause some suppliers to never afford the packages sold by IndiaMART thus losing out revenues from them. This leaves room for competitors to come up with niche platforms to grab these customers. The company said it will work on this direction after two to three years.\nDisclosure:\nI have no investments in the company, but the opportunity looks interesting to me. This is not a buy / sell recommendation. Investors are expected to do their due diligence before buying / selling shares of IndiaMART. I’m not a SEBI registered advisor.','Jan 19, 2020 11:08 pm'),(939,282,273,'Actually checked my LinkedIn network and realized I have a friend working at Udaan. Here are some points I have noted from my conversation with him.\nUdaan’s current product lines are on items which are smaller in size, as that is what their current logistics infrastructure can support. But in the long run, the product categories would be expanded to larger items.\n97% of business in India is B2B. So there is a much higher potential than B2C and thus valuations of Udaan reached so high (~3 Billion USD) in just three years.\nUdaan’s current focus is more on connecting product distributors to retailers while IndiaMART’s focus is on connecting manufacturing SMEs to other manufacturing SMEs. However, in the long run, Udaan plans to increase their perimeter of business to all kinds of B2B.\nEmployees at Udaan don’t discuss much about IndiaMART in their office but discuss a lot about Reliance and Flipkart. My guess is this is because these are more focussed on the distributor to retailer network.\nUdaan has got its own NBFC license to write off loans to buyers.\nOn the logistics side, 70% of orders in Udaan go through Udaan Express, while 30% go through third party vendors. They go through Udaan Express when they have a lot of orders going through the same route, but use third party vendors when the orders are thinly spread.\nUdaan is giving away huge discounts on the logistics side. In fact, delivery used to be free a while ago and now, they have started charging but still at huge discounts. In a given vertical, their losses are a multiple of their revenues.\nMy inference: Such aggression by Udaan will definitely be worrying for investors of IndiaMART. It will only increase with time as Udaan is just three years old. Udaan not being present in most categories of IndiaMART can give comfort for next one or two years.\nDisclosures: Same as above.','Jan 20, 2020 12:07 am'),(940,282,273,'Attaching my Deep Dive Notes.\nIndiaMART.pdf (169.6 KB)\nDiscl: I don’t have IndiaMART on my portfolio.

Looking at it from OCF perspective suggests it is actually cheap on valuation parameters.\nTalked to a Flipkart employee today who works in Flipkart B2B. He is working at Flipkart since 2015 and is highly regarded by my friend who is also working at Flipkart since 2019.\nFlipkart B2B is E-commerce of finished products between the manufacturer and the retailer, unlike IndiaMART which does E-commerce between manufacturing SMEs. The reason why Flipkart chose this path is because it is already running a B2C E-commerce business of those finished products. This would bring in lots of data on how to manage their inventory, drive sales and lot more. However, Flipkart has plans to enter all aspects of B2B E-commerce in the long run. Udaan’s thought process is also in similar lines. Note that Udaan’s founders were mid to senior management professionals at Flipkart.\nFlipkart is a Tech company while IndiaMART is a business sales company. i.e. Flipkart has crores of customers and it can’t have a sales team to convince them to use Flipkart. The technology should drive it. While IndiaMART actually has a sales team to sell their product to SMEs, so technology relatively plays a smaller role in IndiaMART.\nLAST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT\nIndiaMART’s subscription business value-add is in the ‘Discovery’ of the customers. Once a supplier takes the subscription for two to three years, the incremental value-add of having the subscription for the next year will not be the same and will keep decreasing with time. Once the buyer gets the contact of the supplier and vice versa, they can continue their business without involving IndiaMART.\nFYI, IndiaMART’s churn rates hover around 20%, which is on the higher side for internet subscription businesses.\nDiscl: No holdings.

ARPU is 45k per year. 10% cost is just IndiaMART implies total expenses to be about 4.5 lakhs per year and assuming high margins of 10%, revenues at 5 lakhs per year. But I don’t think these are the numbers for a typical SME.\nMSMEs revenues grow faster than IndiaMART’s ARPU. I don’t think this is the case with GST and shift to organized businesses (COVID-19 will only speeden it up).\nBelow is what I have in my mind about ho the P&L statements of MSMEs look like:\nMicro => less than 5 crores revenues\nSmall => 5 to 75 crores revenues\nMedium => 75 to 250 crores revenues\nI’m assuming very low margins for MSMEs, say 1% - 2%. MSMEs generally manufacture commoditized / low value-add products.\n=> Micro enterprises make about 3-4 lakhs profits per year\n=> Small enterprises make about 50 lakhs profits per year\n=> Medium enterprises make about 1-2 cr profits per year\nPlease note that these profits are generally used for bread and butter by the owners for those businesses as that would be the only source of income. Among those I think only Medium sized companies will fall into the category of “comfortably” maintaining the subscription without any churn.\nI never had a conversation with any SME entrepreneur and don’t understand what / how they think or run their business.

Here are some points I have noted from my conversation with him.\nUdaan’s current product lines are on items which are smaller in size, as that is what their current logistics infrastructure can support. But in the long run, the product categories would be expanded to larger items.\n97% of business in India is B2B. So there is a much higher potential than B2C and thus valuations of Udaan reached so high (~3 Billion USD) in just three years.\nUdaan’s current focus is more on connecting product distributors to retailers while IndiaMART’s focus is on connecting manufacturing SMEs to other manufacturing SMEs. However, in the long run, Udaan plans to increase their perimeter of business to all kinds of B2B.\nEmployees at Udaan don’t discuss much about IndiaMART in their office but discuss a lot about Reliance and Flipkart. My guess is this is because these are more focussed on the distributor to retailer network.\nUdaan has got its own NBFC license to write off loans to buyers.\nOn the logistics side, 70% of orders in Udaan go through Udaan Express, while 30% go through third party vendors. They go through Udaan Express when they have a lot of orders going through the same route, but use third party vendors when the orders are thinly spread.\nUdaan is giving away huge discounts on the logistics side. In fact, delivery used to be free a while ago and now, they have started charging but still at huge discounts. In a given vertical, their losses are a multiple of their revenues.\nMy inference: Such aggression by Udaan will definitely be worrying for investors of IndiaMART. It will only increase with time as Udaan is just three years old. Udaan not being present in most categories of IndiaMART can give comfort for next one or two years.\nDisclosures: Same as above.','Aug 30, 2019 5:04 pm'),(948,282,55,'Thanks @lingalarahul7.

But the feedback answers on Quora are mostly negative referring mainly to fake leads, fake suppliers and so on. The issue with verification of suppliers is also common. I considered this as odd for a company that claims to value its customers.\nAnother (positive?) point which users mention is that IndiaMart is not as polished as Alibaba, but is the best there is in India.\nCould this be a red flag or is this common in all such B2B platforms?','Aug 30, 2019 5:04 pm'),(951,282,292,'Hi,\nI feel both the questions you asked are very valid and we should try to find out more information about this.\nI did go through Google Shopping and everything about the website screams B2C. Even after digging deeper, I could not find a few niche products that any typical B2B website would have. Amazon does have a B2B segment in India but that focuses only on finished goods corporations would need like IT Products, Stationery, Cleaning Materials, etc. The reason Indiamart is unique is because it is the only truly B2B marketplace in India where you can find every product a business requires. If you are a tyre manufacturer who needs a special chemical, Indiamart is the easiest way to find one. If you want bottle caps for your soft drink bottle, Indiamart is the place to find a manufacturer for it. You will struggle to find any other comparables which provide such a wide range of products. Alibaba in China is the most well known example outside India.\nThere is always a threat of a tech giant swooping into this market. Like you said, right now it would be too premature to assume that it can never happen. However, I do not see any such threat visible in the near term simply because this seems a whole different arena than the arena they are currently playing in. Amazon has spent years mastering consumer logistics. The logistics to deliver a phone and the logistics to deliver 10,000 bottle caps are completely different. There are too many niches in this segment and the unit economics would be incredibly difficult. This is the reason Indiamart too exited this model and focused on subscription model. I have not seen Amazon do anything similar in US or any other country. I would assume they would try this model in their home market first rather than directly in a country like India. Even if they ever do plan to start something, it would be more on the lines of what Udaan is doing(Finished goods) than what Indiamart does.\nSo Zee Marathi and Radio Mirchi have launched their own B2B websites? I have not come across them but in case they have, the threat would not be high. Indiamart’s moat in the their network benefits. It has an incredible first mover advantage and for anybody else to reach the number of listings and buyers would require years of marketing and advertising.\nIndiamart’s unique advantage is the wide variety of products available on its website. To a normal individual it is hard to fathom the number of raw materials to make a finished good. Around 200 raw materials are required just to make a tyre. It will be extremely difficult for a new entrant to replicate the sheer breadth of products.\nDisclosure - Invested and hence views might be biased.','Aug 30, 2019 5:04 pm'),(952,282,47,'On the chart, the current phase is a sideways.

And when I saw 30% of current turnover in advances, it really got my attention. The numbers are there for everybody to see on Screener. I personally think this one is undervalued and have bought some quantity yesterday and today.\nA few comments before I delve deeper into the analysis.\na) Not any and all pharma related stocks will command a premium PE (PE>15). Have a look at Medi-caps for example. So painting all pharma stocks with a broad brush would lead to erroneous analysis.\nb) Yes, it was extremely under-valued say 4-6 months back. But at that point of time, I would not have invested since I would be speculating with the information that was available back then. Hindsight bias always strikes when a trade goes right. But now, with revised information and AR getting published very recently (maybe 15 days back), we now know that 30% of turnover is already advanced by customers and their plans and outlook for the future. With this new information, I saw it as undervalued at these levels and have invested in it. Of course, there is a possibility that the trade is wrong, but as long as I have convinced myself with available information and not shooting in the dark, I am ok to lose money.\nc) The biggest gains are made, in my opinion, when businesses are on the cusp of growth and also come under the funds radar. This business is no doubt on the cusp of growth but fund recognition might take time since it is still a 100 cr turnover business. But 2-3 years down the line, if and when the hit the 300 cr mark, and if they continue with this performance, funds will jump in and that’s when you;ll see the highest gains. Not immediately.\nAnyhow, enough of global stuff. So, as I said, I got interested in the stock due to customer advances, read through all available ARs and framed a list of questions. I contacted the best pharma analyst I know, Ayush and asked him these questions. I present the Q&A here. Caplin’s corporate office is in Chennai. So, if anyone here is from Chennai, please do make an effort to have an appointment with the management. I am sure if enough Valuepickrs see undervaluation here, we’ll not be short of an intelligent questionnaire. Chennai-folks, please raise a hand if you are interested.\nQ&A with Ayush follows (K is Kiran, A is Ayush below):\n)------\nK: Business model of Caplin â Who are their customers? Aid agencies in Africa and South/Central America (AR 2009)? Why are they paying so much in advance? In 2009 annual report, Caplin clearly states that they insist on upfront payment. How does this work â in your experience, have you seen any other business like this?\nA: Due to this being a small cap, there is not much information out there. My hypothesis is some big pharma co. is backing these folks and putting them in touch with various customers and agencies. This is most likely a B2B kind of thing and not B2C. The business value chain is not very clear even though I have been tracking this co. for a while now.\nK: They keep talking of unique business model/unique marketing strategy in almost all ARs â any insights here?\nA: Nope. An interview with management would help a great deal here. In my experience, they respond to any shareholder very promptly.\nK: There doesnât seem to be any seasonality in the business. Even if you take out the forex gains in Sep quarter, year on year EPS jump is close to 70% which is extremely healthy.Expected EPS? I see it as 10-11 if a similar performance and margin basis continues and without forex gains. With such growth and even at 10 PE, we are looking at 50% appreciation.\nA: Yep, even my guess is around the same level given no black swan event. I don’t know the how and why of forex losses last year and gains this year though. So unless we meet the management, we wouldn’t know at what levels have they hedged their exports.\nK: This seems to be a clear traded goods, contract manufacturing play. Am I right in that? Why canât anybody do it? And why are net margins close to 10% in a commodity play?\nA: Net margins are close to 8% and not 10%. See, the entire play here is they are moving up the value chain. From tablets and ointments currently, they are setting up an injectibles plant which have higher margins. Let’s say I assume the big pharma company helps them get through the US/UK FDA approvals quickly, and even the big pharma company squeezes these guys’ margins to the current level, the volume explosion from the current level itself should move them to the next orbit. Look, for a 100 cr turnover business, setting up a plant worth Rs. 25 cr would not have been a shot in the dark. They already might have a big customer or two lined up (maybe the big pharma co. backing them itself provides the demand and advances)\nK: This new plant that they talk about â finish by Dec 2012 and commercial production by mid-2013. Shouldnât the authorities in US/UK give permission? And if their major customers till now are aid agencies, then how are they even penetrating this market and who are the customers buying this stuff? Doesnât the approvals time extend to a year or two?\nA: If aid agencies are their customers, then I am not really sure how they would get the approvals so quickly. US FDA takes 1-2 years, but UK is pretty ok. This in turn, leads me to the hypothesis that some big pharma co. is backing them and hence the approvals would come in quickly, else they would not set up a 25cr plant just like that.\nK: Argus Salud Pharma â in 2011 AR, they say this HP plant has handsomely added to the topline and bottomline. However, look at the current AR, and the consolidated is actually slightly less than standalone. Now, given that this is the only subsidiary, isnât the conclusion that Argus is just about breaking even?\nA: Yep, this seems to be the only disconnect between the talk and walk of management. We should ask the management this question though.\nK: Any cashflow â earnings mismatch you found?\nA: Not as far as I could see. Taxes are being paid, dividends are being paid, fixed assets are growing, there is no inventory problem, there is no debtor problem, the balance sheet is in terrific shape.\n)—\nSo, that was the end of our Q&A.

Mr Jayapal is the Managing Director and the\npromoters hold a 57% stake in CPL\nThe Rs1bn CPL does contract manufacturing for a wide range of dosage forms (tablets, capsules, liquid orals, powder,\nSVP, ointments and lyophilized products). CPL derives ~90% of its Rs1bn revenues from the international market (nonregulated\nmarkets) and is presently expanding capacities to manufacture hormone and sterile injectibles aimed at the\nregulated markets through facilities which would be compliant with the US FDA and UK MHRA.\nThe story ahead ccc…\nThe facility to manufacture sterile speciality products would go on stream in 3 phases . Phase -1 during Q4 of the current\nfiscal, Phase -2 during Q2 next fiscal and Phase -3 during FYf14-15. CPL is virtually a debt-free company and has cash of\nRs275mn in its books as of June 2012 (CPL follows a June YE). We believe that CPL going forward would show enough\ntraction in its business year over year as its business model is evolving in the right direction. Despite being a\npredominantly export driven company ( 90% exports) we are also impressed with its product lines for the domestic market\nand our channel checks suggest that products manufactured by CPL is gaining acceptance rapidly during CYf12.\nImports constitute close to 40% of its revenues and the company wrote off an exchange loss of Rs50mn in FYf12 which\nnegatively impacted its profitability last fiscal (CPL posted a net profit of Rs82mn after the FX loss of Rs50mn). We\nbelieve that its business model can generate an ROCE of 30% every year as we foresee revenues to grow @ CAGR of\n50% over the next few years with a rise in profitability.

Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with any serious allegations, so will STAY AWAY. If I can’t make serious allocation of Capital, why bother?\nBut let’s shift the discussion back to gaps in the story - there are many things that don’t add up.\n1). A completely me-too product range (analgesics, anti-infectives,etc) that everyone knows is hugely competitive, very low margins - but company’s cash flows/financials seem to tell a different story\n2). The company obviously does not find it viable to supply/compete in the domestic market (~90% is exports); but works out viable (very profitable) business models in far away minuscule (unregulated?) South American and African markets\n3). When questioned about its biggest markets by individual investors/analysts (Kiran) - Brazil & Mexico are cited (in company website these were planned for 2012), but to Institutional analysts Nicaragua, Honuras, Gautamela are cited. (This was highly disturbing for me - putting up a different face for different audiences!). Some of these countries have an annual pharma market of ~200 Cr only.\n4). The main attraction in company’s cash flows/financials - Advances of 41 Cr! This is practically financing the new expansion of injectibles! A very happy situation to be in for sure.BUT why would distributors pay 6m Advances for these kind of low-end generics products? why would these be sustainable??\nIndividual and Institutional analysts did not seem to have got to the bottom of this crucial question, despite my constant egging:)\n5). I would stick my neck out and say - The company seems to have workable business model for small unregulated markets. In a few markets (Gautemela, Honduras, Guinea) the business model is so formidable as to command big Advances from distributors (reasons not known at the moment). Safe to say the company would find it pretty difficult to expand presence in bigger semi-regulated markets like Brazil & Mexico. The current business model may not be replicatable (for existing product range).\nIn my book, we need to have convincing answers on these fronts. We need to be able to reconcile inconsistencies in the overall story (at the moment I find there are just too many, of course without the benefit of a management interaction).\nCan some of the bulls in the story (nothing wrong with that:)) make attempts to defend/answer the above inconsistencies that I see.\nThanks\n)- Donald\nPS: What may be differentiating this company from 1000’s of small companies manufacturing similar product range is the China advantage.

First, the allegation was more than a decade ago (similar argument was given when i posted about Wimplast’s Pradip G Rathod’s involvement with Sanjay Dangi in price rigging, but we are staying in there and staying away here!). Secondly, if someone can make fake drug, it can also make fake packaging. Why will someone write one’s company’s name on fakes. One can write anyone’s name. The info I have from my sources is that the fake drug makers used caplin’s packaging.\n2). Co is intogeneral medicines because of the business model it has. It targets GPs in 3rd world countries. GPs mainly prescribe general medicines. Specialist doctors prescribe speciality medicines like cardiac, dermatolgy etc. Co’s distribution model is not MR-driven but pharmacy-driven. In India, pharma distribution is MR-driven and hence is a totally different game. Comapny is trying MR-driven model in Africa on pilot.\n3 &4&5). It does not sell to distributors but controls distribution there because of years spent by promoters in central american countries. Promoters also have marital ties with natives there. It sells in smaller central americal countries you mentioned and not inbrazil or mexico. Effectively, pharmacies are its customers and that explains advances. Being a manufacturer cum distributor, it offers medicines at much lower prices in lieu of advances.\n4). Advances/sales will not sustain when its injectible plants commence in the 2nd half of this fiscal, as that will be a totally different business model. It is likely to be contract manufacturing for other pharma companies.\n5 The big story here is that of injectible plants and the kind of valuation at which Strides, Claris and Orchid (Hospira)have sold their injectible businesses. All these three were saddled with huge debts. Caplin will have no debt even afterputting up 80crore injectible plant.

Zelaya had faced widespread criticism for attempting to extend presidential term limits by holding a constitutional referendum, which the Supreme Court had ruled was illegal. A group of countries, including the United States and Venezuelaaan unlikely alliance, signed a resolution condemning the actions of the Honduran military and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated as president. The U.S. suspended military and development aid to Honduras after the coup. Roberto Micheletti, with the backing of the Honduran Congress, courts, and army, assumed leadership of the country. Zelaya, on the other hand, had the support of most of Latin America’s leftist governments, including the leaders of Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela.\nZelaya attempted to return to his country by plane on July 5, but he found a closed runway and well-armed Honduran troops on the ground waiting for him. In September, Zelaya secretly returned to Honduras, taking refuge in the Brazilian embassy. Micheletti responded by temporarily cutting off power and water to the embassy, suspending constitutional freedoms, and shuttering a television channel and a radio station. The moves met widespread criticism from within Honduras and abroad, and Micheletti rescinded his restrictions.\nThe U.S. brokered an agreement between Zelaya and Micheletti in late October that left Zelaya’s reinstatement up to a Congressional vote, called for the establishment of a government of national unity and a truth commission, and required Zelaya to abandon a referendum on constitutional reform. The accord, however, fell apart within days, as Micheletti reportedly attempted to form a government that did not include Zelaya.\nIn November presidential elections, Porfirio Lobo, the candidate of the conservative National Party, defeated Elvin Santos, who represented the Liberal Party, 56% to 38%. Zelaya refused to recognize the results of the election. In December, Congress rejected a plan to allow Zelaya to return to office. Lobo took office in January 2010, thus ending seven months of political turmoil.\nOn May 28, 2011, nearly two years after he was ousted in a court- and legislature-backed coup, Manuel Zelaya returned to his home country. As part of a prearranged deal, prosecutors dropped corruption and constitution violation charges against the former president and Honduras was readmitted to the Organization of American States (OAS).','Nov 20, 2013 11:05 am'),(1048,286,344,'Hi Rskm,\nAdmin and Donald have given opinion based on the actual company visit, management meet and even employee interviews we had done (there were 5 of us).

Points in italics are points/questions of @Hao-ming\nHi Hao,\nWhile i agree in principle to the hypothesis that Bandhan being a bank has certain benefits over GK, there are few broad points that I would like to highlight before taking each of the questions.\nThe FS space is large for multiple players to exists, and therefore you can have both a HDFC Bank as well as Bajaj who offer the same products and can have an overlap in customer base. Therefore I would not discount GK just cause Bandhan is also playing in the same field and Bandhan is a bank.\nBandhan post getting the bank license, has to under-go certain changes which may or may not let it remain a hard-core MFI business (i.e. RBI’s discomfort in Bandhan having such a large MFI loan book and therefore Bandhan is trying to reduce the MFI loan book proportion; acquisition of Gruh leading to entry into the higher than the MFI customer base; need to manage the CASA side of business as well)\nI have received the Bandhan shares as part of the Gruh transaction, therefore hold both the companies, therefore would try to remain neutral while responding\nHow is it better than a bandhan bank as a business…\nEven bandhan is in mfi… Bread and butter business of bandhan is still mfi…\nNow being a bank bandhan will have low cost of acquisition of funds… Hence bandhan can lend at a considerably lower rate…\n2) also bandhan is diversified… Has housing Finance, bank and mfi…\nWhile evaluating Bandhan one has to look at three aspects:\nMicrofinance business -> The core of the Bandhan operations have remained within West Bengal and Asaam (62% of portfolio); Assam has had its own challenges of over-lending of customers leading to reduction in On-time repayment as well as spike in NPA. From the distribution of branch network it can be seen that the next largest network is present in Bihar. Therefore Bandhan’s MFI book is largely confined in WB, Assam, Bihar vs. GK operates more in the southern region of the country therefore limited overlap. -> Thus limited competition to GK from BB\nGRUH business -> GRUH with its erstwhile HDFC parentage, has a very good loan book, and now with Bandhan transaction there is potential for geographical expansion, however the customer base is very different (avg. loan 8.3 Lakhs in June 2019). Also with txn. happening BB’s focus will shift on growing Gruh’s book thus from management bandwidth perspective there are two businesses which are targeted to different customer segments vis-à-vis GK who has only one customer segment to target (which is usually the NBFC [single product] vs Bank [multi product] story)-> Thus management bandwidth and focus towards MFI for GK vs BB remains in favour of GK\nLiability business -> GK doesn’t need to build this business, whereas for BB maintaining and growing becomes even a larger challenge as the MFI customers maintaining deposit with BB constitutes a very small %, therefore one more customer segment for BB to focus upon. Being a bank and having access to retail deposit provides advantage to Bandhan from steadiness of deposits as well as at a cheaper rate, which can be passed on to the customers. -> Thus advantage to BB over GK wrt cost of funds, but again another customer segment to target adds one more aspect to management bandwidth of the BB management\nSo in summary, competencies required for growing a NBFC book focussing on a single product is far easier than building a bank business. And while it is true that BB started as MFI and is still core to BB’s business, there are many other business vying for the management attention and focus. And even though BB has lower cost of funds, there is limited overlap in the geography of operations.\n3) as competition gets big because everyone wants to diversify will this company survive onslaught of say bandhan bank or other banks per say who have access to lower cost of funds.\nThe only players that I think exist as competition for MFIs are the SFBs (which had an existing field-operations required to manage MFI operations), however like Bandhan even SFBs are diversifying from the core MFI borrower customers therefore the intensity of competition may reduce. Another player who can pose a challenge is BFIL under the IndusInd, but GK has been competing with BFIL for long and there is anyways space for multiple players to exist.\nIn all honesty I didn’t get your question, when any FI wants to diversify and grow their business they want to target businesses which are of higher ticket size and not lower ticket size that MFI business typically operates at. Banks are more comfortable in providing loans to MFIs to get PSL benefits (on-lending link) rather than build their own network and competencies as the business operating model is very difficult to manage (digital lending doesn’t works as large base of MFI customers don’t have smartphones)\n4) bandhan bank CEO has major stake in the business hence skin in the game… Whereas I see no advantage of this in CAG.\nAgreed Bandhan’s CEO has major stake, but due to the dilution requirements the stake is required to be reduced to 40% and over a period of time reduce to 15% in 20 years (I think). While 20 years is a long time, but already shareholding of Mr. Ghosh has reduced to 60% vis-à-vis GK’s promoter whose holding will come to down to 75% in 2 more years.\nThe CAG promoter have varied and international experience in driving MFI business, so its not a case of an uninterested or unaware shareholders and additionally the BoD has three nominee directors, 5 independent directors and only one ED i.e. the CEO; therefore management should ideally operate in an responsible manner and will remain answerable to the shareholders.\nNot trying to just defend the point, but the shareholding and CEO doesn’t necessarily has a direct relation case in point Yes Bank vs Kotak Mahindra Bank.\n5) HOW reliable are the numbers?.. Are we sure that gnpa and nnpa is bang on nose without any divergences.\nWhile there is no AQR for NBFCs, the sector in general has had lower NPAs compared to other financial products of banks. This is mainly driven from the following factors:\nRural MFIs typically operate in geographies where banking network is very small/limited and customers are also intimidated to approach bank branches\nAvailability of the credit bureau (and customers are also aware about it) makes the customer pay the loans on time, as they know default with one lender limits their ability to borrow from other lenders (who are already limited in a particular village)\nUnlike banks which follow RBI defined Standard, Sub-standard, Doubtful and Write-offs, NBFCs are required to follow Expected Credit Loss Model where in the NBFC themselves estimates expected loss. While defining their ECL mode, GK has also taken inputs from its auditors on the approach and assumptions (refer page 93 of the FY 19 Annual Report).\nGK had transitioned to ECL model which led to higher GNPAs and on-top of that GK has provided additional provisioning, therefore I would like to say that the numbers are reliable.\n5) CAG looks more like a commodity business ( plain vanilla lending)…\n, isn’t every lending business a commodity business IMHO in lending the differentiator lies in the lenders ability to:\nIdentify good customers [here GK doesn’t have much choice/ practices discretion apart from MFIN guidelines]\nCross-sell / Retain customer to get more and more income post acquisition [Retention we have already covered, as part of renewal of loans rejects about 30% of the customers as well as the loan amount is dependent on attendance, on-time payment]\nService them in a low cost manner [lowest cost service provide, comparable to Bandhan]\nProvision conservatively\n6) can these survive in tougher economic conditions.\nWon’t the PAR’s increase given the state of situation globally\nAgree, the company and in fact all lenders are exposed to this risk. MFIs are more exposed that banks as the collection is physical rather than digital for banks.\n7) what is the moat here… If we talk about customer retention rate… Even bandhan does a good job of retaining…\nThe moat I don’t think is customer retention, as IMHO customer retention is an outcome and not what differentiates the business. The moat that GK has compared to others are:\nAbility to offer customized products to customer [ticket size, repayment frequency]\nService customer at low cost\nInvestment in technology, enabling centralization through the RPCs\nAs per my estimate, 10% improvement in retention rate leads to 1% lower Opex; and thus retention plays a virtuous cycle role in maintaining low opex.\n8) why would to want to pay 4.5 times the book for such business? Is it superior than hdfc bank… Why buy CAG When hdfc bank is cheaper…\nThe customer segments are very different between HDFC Bank and GK. Purely from metrics perspective, RoA for GK is 4.6% vs HDFC Bank’s 2%; post IPO GK’s leverage came down and is steadily increasing, and RoE of GK is 16.5% (with lower leverage) vs HDFC’s 17%; P/B and P/E is an easy metric to compare two businesses, however it is the RoE which matter in my opinion.\nAlso have u considered the sudden loan waivers govts do as soon as they come to power?..\nMight be once in a time type of Black Swan events but needs to be provided…\nTypically the loan waivers are given to bank loans and not for MFIs therefore the loan waiver risk doesn’t exists for MFIs; however it does impacts the credit culture which is the bigger risk.\nOn the positives\nhas a mnc parentage. Suppose company goofs up parent might help out… Assuming they don’t dilute equity…\nnot incentivising CRE TO push loans…\nI am not saying your decision is bad or anything…\nI would want you to substantiate ur buy call…\nIn the hindsight don’t you feel paying 4.5 times book was bad… Irrespective of the correction…\nThe only reason markets was paying premium was because of growth…\nAlso have u considered the sudden loan waivers govts do as soon as they come to power?..\nMight be once in a time type of Black Swan events but needs to be provided…\nMy opinion is these companies are best buy at 1 or 1.5 times book… Not beyond that…\nU are free to counter this theory… Hv a good day','Mar 30, 2020 9:06 am'),(1068,287,354,'FY2020 Results\n\nMMFL has been acquired & consolidated in the last few days of March, Hence one should look at its number prospectively.\nOne thing I found quite interesting is that if you compare the average loan outstanding per customer of both CreditAccess (CAGL) & MMFL (Madura Microfinance Ltd), the average loan outstanding of CAGL is 2x of MMFL.

Deloitte Haskins & Sells, which is also a reputed firm. I strongly believe the company will bounce back as defaults in MFI will be lower than the entire lending industry mainly because 86% of their book is in rural areas which is hardly affected. Moreover, the JLG structure helps in lower defaults.

Management expects to reach 40% capacity utilization of Optical Brightening Agent (OBA) within the FWA division, by the year end FY 2015 where the segment will cash break even.

Key highlights by Capital Mkt\nThere was a continuous moderation in prices of Bulk Chemicals and some specialty chemicals and fuel additives as well due to continuous fall in crude oil prices. What happens is in a downward spiral of raw material prices, there is a destocking of inventory and demand compression starts taking place. Demand generally gets postponed during such times. So while fundamentals remain unchanged, no company would like to lock in the inventories. This resulted in lower sales and profits for Q3 FY’15. Once crude price stabilize, sales growth will improve\nWhile situation continues, there is some improvement on QoQ basis. Management is hopeful for things to be better from February 2015 end onwards. Overall Q4 will be better than Q3 FY’15 but will continue to be tepid compared to Q4 on YoY basis.\nOBA business is not affected in any way by crude oil. Also US which is major markets for OBA, continues to do well. Current production of OBA stands at 22% and it will take about 55% of capacity utilization to break even, which the management expects to happen in H2 FY’16.

Also it surrendered its lease hold right on an adjusting land which generated around Rs 9.66 crore. These funds together with around Rs 83 crore from QIP proceeds will contribute towards the funding requirements for the green field project of Phenol and Aceton in Dahej.\nAlready around Rs 67 crore has been deployed on the project. The company has also started the seed marketing of Phenol and has achieved good response.\nThe company will have a Phenol capacity of around 2 lakh tons. The total market demand of Phenol in India is around 2.6 lakh tons and is growing around 5-7% every year 80% of the total requirements is imported. There are 2 local players who are smaller in size and capability and one of them is earning Ebidta of around 15%. Thus the demand in local market will absorb entire production of the company.\nCurrently, Phenol is imported largely from US, EU and China in India. Further Indian government has already imposed anti dumping duty on imports of Acetone and Phenol in India in lieu of Make in India concept. Management expects the demand of Phenol to increase further given the change in consumption trend of end user industry.\nThe company, within the fine specialty chemicals business, has been able to add new pharmaceutical and personal care customers which are high potential business. The revenues put together from these businesses were around Rs 40 crore in FY’16. Given the pipeline of expected business and interactions with the customers, management expects this business to reach to around Rs 300 crore in next 3 years.\nOBA turnover stood at Rs 171 crore as compared to Rs 121 crore for Mar’15. OBA segment reached Ebidta break in Mar’16 quarter. Management expects a turnover of more than Rs 250 crore from this segment in FY’17, with break even at PAT level. Even at Rs 325 crore of turnover, the company will be operating only at around 65% of capacity utilization. The company is working with more than 100 clients predominately in Glass, Detergents and Paper segments.\nNo major capex planned for FY’17 barring Rs 50 crore for normal business and Phenol and Acetone green field projects.\nOverall, going forward, management expects a minimum 100 bps margin improvement every year for next 3 years on an annualized basis, with higher margin and realization products share increasing and with OBA breaking even.\nOverall, management is not worried that much due to global recession and is confident of higher volumes and margins going forward.','May 18, 2016 7:05 pm'),(1089,288,363,'Guys, seems like this company is not attracting much attention from all boarders.

As per my research, the biggest players in the speciality fluorochemical space are Honeywell, Chemours (DuPont), Daikin, Solvay, Asahi Glass Corporation and 3M (Dyneon). The total flurochemical sales of these companies in 2019 was ~ $15 bn, roughly equally split between them at $ 2-5 bn each (75%+ market share). Fluorochemicals was less than 10% for all, except Chemours and Solvay where it has about half the business. Simply translating the multiples on their overall business to the fluorochemicals sub segment , market cap of these verticals is about ~$3 bn on average , with Honeywell at $9 bn.\nNavin Fluorines current market cap is about $1.5 bn with about $150 million in sales. Refrigerant business is an oligopoly in India and HF acid is a commodity input. India has no captive fluorspar production and relies heavily on China for feedstock (China has 55%+ share of global fluorspar production) though we are diversifying to Kenya and South Africa. I’m uncertain that current valuations leave any room for growth over the next 5-10 years as the overall fluorochemical market appears small and oligopolistic at the top , and the size of companies and their market caps don’t provide any cushion - Navin is 1/20th the size and 80% of the average market cap. Even getting to a $1 billion in this market looks to be a real challenge if you’re going up against the giants above - R&D spends seem to be just 2-5% so that means the downstream CRAMs market for this industry would be capped at less than $1 billion globally for this market. Navin’s CRAMS has a wider base with life sciences cos, but unsure of what services they provide exactly and how much of a pharma R&D budgets would be devoted to fluorine , which from what I gather improves absorption of APIs.\nThis may be a naive analysis and I may be missing something obvious, do please correct me, but seems at first glance to be v richly priced.','Aug 13, 2020 11:05 pm'),(1131,289,89,'ICICI Direct has initiated coverage on Navin Fluorine.\nicicidirect.com 159\n159\nIDirect_Chemical_SectorReport_Oct20.pdf 159\n3.18 MB','Oct 12, 2020 1:58 am'),(1132,289,89,'Nirmal Bang has initiated coverage on Navin Fluorine.\nnirmalbang.com 157\n157\nIndia-Specialty-Chemicals-Sector---16-October-2020.pdf 157\n5.36 MB','Oct 17, 2020 2:30 pm'),(1133,289,140,'Highlights of the Concall by Capital Mkt\nNet revenues rose 16% to Rs 150 crore for Q1FY’16 on a YoY basis while EBITDA increased 117% to Rs 26 crore and PAT jumped 113% to Rs 18 crore.EBITDA margin of the company improved to 17% in Q1FY’16 from 9% in Q1FY’15 mainly on account of operating leverage.Revenue growth across business units was driven by higher volumes and better realizations\nRefrigerants revenue increased 22% on a YoY basis in Q1FY’16 to Rs 61 crore and 24% on a QoQ basis.

Current capex includes civil works provision for further expansion (only equipment will be needed), leading to asset turnover of 1.4x but better margins. NFIL believes some of these products will attain bigger size in the next 3-4 years and would require dedicated plants. NFIL has also back-up of 7 products (mix of agrochem and pharma), yet to be commercialized, which can be manufactured in the same MPP. NFIL may also go ahead with separate plants or expansion of proposed MPP for these products based on the commercialization and progression of 5 products to dedicated plants. The company believes this capex is a launchpad and opens up possibility for more similar capex going ahead. NFIL is confident of more capex announcements in specialty chemicals before commissioning of this MPP.\nRevenue potential:\n· Peak Revenue potential of Rs2.6-2.8bn and expected to reach in next 2-3 years post commissioning of the plant with slightly higher than current EBITDA margin and similar RoCE profile\n· Management expects the project to start generating revenue from 2HFY23.\n· Capex includes civil works also and provision for future expansion. For future expansion, NFIL will just need to add the equipment and can expand by 40%.\nMPP will cater to 5 products:\n· This MPP is for 5 products catering to agrochemicals. All the 5 products have been commercialized in the past one year and customers are banking on these products to become successful.\n· These products are based on fluorination chemistry but involves more and complex steps\n· NFIL is 2nd vendor for three of the products and the 1st vendor is from EU/USA.

One of our main customers had actually taken a shutdown for a month so the sales into that non-invasive category was low and that is clearly a high margin business versus exports of R22 which actually grew in this particular quarter and is a low margin business.

Second, one has to observe the common patterns in the entire industry. Third, to connect the dots among all these different happenings and finally, unearth the blind spots,a says Jain, adding a theoretical layer to his explanation.\nThis methodical approach meant that the demerger process went on smoothly from all standpoints. For example, Jain and his senior team conducted informal sessions with various subject matter experts and external consultants on what the regulatory expectations were from a documentation standpoint. Jain says, aWe uncovered a fund of information from such sessions and acted upon the findings. Our thorough work in this regard meant that there were no delays in response from regulatory bodies or the court.a\nTo be sure, the concept of design thinking is something the company wants to use in both its services and products businesses across processes; right from the macro level, where business, technology, people and operations come together to the level of adding features to a particular product.\nThe macro vision\nPolaris 4.0 also earmarks a new phase in the entrepreneurial journey of Jain. A 25-year veteran in this industry, Jainas day-to-day role now includes that of a coach for his five CEOs. He says, aI am glad to say that weave now attracted the best of talent from the industry. My personal role will be to help our CEOs uncover any blind spots they encounter, be it in strategy, systems, style or organisational structure.a\nAdditionally, Jain also runs workshops with his team members a project managers and above. Branded Unmukt, these workshops focus on upping the aspirational quotient of his people. aIn addition to skill development, one of the key aspects of building organisations is to improve the mindset of people,a he adds. Jainas theory is that the whole organisation needs to be aligned to specific purposes. If one of the companyas goals is to reduce complexity in the customer environment, this whole thought has to be internalized, by the entire organisation.\nWith the de-merger almost complete, Jain and his team are now gearing up for the next phase of growth. When Jain used the words asoul of a startupa in his note to shareholders, he was referring to the renewed agility of each line of business, a spirit of entrepreneurship where each CEO is completely empowered to grow his piece of the business and to unearth the potential of a powerful enterprise in its own right.\nTHE ROLE OF DESIGN THINKING IN DECISION-MAKING IS A FOUR-STEP PROCESS.\nJain wants to use the concept of design thinking across the board, right from macro level decision-making to the level of adding features to a particular product.\nFeel the emotional side of any decision\nObserve the common patterns (across the industry)\nConnect the dots among all these different observations\nUnearth the blind spots\nPolaris 1.0\nTill 2001: Touched Rs. 296 crore in revenue with a deep focus on financial technology sourcing for the BFSI industry__\nPolaris 2.0\n2002-2008: Touched Rs. 1,099 crores in revenue, focus on IP building, acquired OrbiTech from Citibank.__\nPolaris 3.0\n2009-2011: Touched Rs. 1,595 crores; complexity reduction for clients, worked with leading global firms in banking, financial services and insurance\nPolaris 4.0\n2012 onwards: Touched Rs. 2,424 crores in FY 2014.

It sold of its logistics software business in 2013-14 for 42 millionUSD. From that same money it paid back a dividend of Rs 29 per share to investors.\nIts current operations as per the march results is only trading computer(rams, graphic cards, cables) and mobile accessories (covers, cases, chargers) through its e commerce portal www.latestone.com 60\nIn press releases Palred plans to be a speciality e commerce site focusing on mobile, computer and tech acccessories. Palred has invested Rs20cr in it and will pump Rs 10cr in the coming 3 months.\nAbout the business\nIts a simple model. Buy it cheap from china, put your name on the cover or product ,sell it online with good margins. I have seen it first hand* ebay shop sellers doing it. Flipkart does it under its brand name ‘digiflip’ (it allows others vendors too, who have the same business model). Latestone. Com does it under ‘ptron’ brand name.\n(Firsthand* - through a close friend who owns a ebay store)\nWhats the USP?\nPalreds promoters claim two things 1) a top notch user friendly website 2) a speciality store. About the first point, without sounding\nbiased its true, it has a ‘lucid’ user interface and mobile customization is comparable to the best. About the second point Mr Srikanth reddy gives an example of a buyer trying to buy a face cream . Would the buyer have a better user exerience and service in a bigbazaar or a health & glow? Health & glow would beat the big walmart type stores with easy access and a wider range of face creams. This is what Palred hopes to achieve a speciality store for all tech acccessories.\nToo DUMB to be SUSTAINABLE ?\nWhy should a listed company bother with something so trivial as mobile cases which any teenage kid can sell on ebay? If it has such lucrative margins others are going to jump in and crush the margins very soon? The following points counteract the obvious risks.\nThere are simply too many different mobiles. Every mobiles has different type of cases. Hard back, soft, rubberised, endless designs, colors etc. Its not feasible for one vendor to stock everything. Small and medium scale vendors cannot do it. Only big sellers like flipkart, ebay and amazon do it by letting others sellers use their portal.\n2)China imports : Small sellers do not have the resources to import on the scale of a focused big vendor like latestone. Plus after NAMO took over, its been a real pain to clear customs, importing small batches of goods like a 1000mobile cases was feasible 2 years back(via china post, fedex) . Now both direct & indirect hassles has been set up to dissuade the small seller from importing.\n3)Margins WILL BE sustained .\nBecause the buyer is ‘willing’ to or more specifically ‘wants’ to pay a higher margin. A ebay sellers tactic will explain this clearly. A seller imports 1000 transparent clear mobile cases for iphone 6 at a price of Rs 20/case. He lists it in ebay. Not in a single listing, but in 4 different prices. Rs 1499, Rs 999, Rs 499, Rs 199. Sales occurs at all price points.The buyer pays the amount he feels is necessary to protect his 70k love of his life. Imagine if the case is not transparent and has a design element to it…… It seems some of the emotional pull the buyer has towards his devices seems to rub of on to the accessories too.\nComputer accessories and cables\nThe above argument does not work here. Its purely commodity model. Latestone hopes to dominate this market by being exhaustive in its collection (ex 1000 different cable types) .

Again I am not promoting the stock or trying to convince anybody, just want to be clear about the redflags before we dump it.\n• About the 190cr cash : As you said 100cr has been paid back as dividend. In its capital reduction plan the company is repurchasing 234,422,182 shares at 16.5Rs per share. Thats a payback of 38.64 cr. It purchased Palred online media for 12 cr , Palred IT for 1 cr. It purchased deal15.com 1 for an unknown amount from premium web services private ltd. According to the promoters Rs 20 cr has been spent on setting up latestone.com plus Rs 10cr to be spent on expanding latestone.com and assured of further cash support from the parent company.\nOnly the redflag about this Rs(12+1) 13 cr related party transaction remain(What management needs to clarify on this) . In that aspect the capital reduction plan is shareholder friendly?\n• I agree with the point that there is zero moat with other sites doing the same. Only differentiation is through web user experience and focus on a niche segment . Just trying to make a point that the website is not a complete ‘dud’ and the market is big enough for new players to make a impact.\n• Agree with you on the point that ‘impressive’ is too big a word for its 9 months perfomance . But we are not expecting a business to churn out profits on the first year? My positive bias was about the sales per day number, From 100/day to 2000/day. Further per day order is expected to be 6000 by the end of the year.\nMy view is its pointless to look for value here. But IF promoters intentions and sales projections of 500cr in 3 years are true .The stock could produce substantial earnings and price gains is a few years.

And Jabong still lost 155 crores for the same year.\nAccess to capital will play a critical role in driving traction and scale for the site, and even then I don’t see them turning a profit for some time. The bigger boys with their deep pockets (Snapdeal, Amazon, Flipkart) have a tendency to price the smaller players out of the market - especially in a commoditized low value product.\nIn addition - If you had to take average selling price of a product on their site at 750 (typically how much people will pay for accessories) - this means they would need to have volume sales of close to 67 lakh orders a year to meet the 500 crore revenue target.\nI am not saying its not possible - just seems improbable IMHO.','May 19, 2015 3:19 pm'),(1318,295,424,'Thanks akshay for the inputs.

But comp has cash eq of 82 cr which will be equal to Rs 53 per share after capital reduction. But since 60% of your total shareholding will be bought back by comp at 16.5 per share so you will only have 40% of shares in account. Market should adjust the price of share accordingly.

However, it may be noted that in 2017-18, 25% revenue comes from Ginning, Cleaning & Bailing of Bleached Cotton.\nThe company exports its product to various countries, and in fact recognized as a two-star export house. Foreign exchange earning has remained to the tune of 100 crores.\nAs per 2020 AR, only 6% of the revenue is coming from Ginning, Cleaning and Bailing of Bleached Cotton, and the rest 94% is coming from medicinal products. With the product shift, the topline has reduced from 170 crores [2018] to 135 crores [2020]. However, the net profit margin has improved from 3% to 5%. The company declared a net profit of 6.5 crores in 2020.\nH1- 2020-21:\nFrom the half yearly results published by company for the FY 2020-21, it appears that the company is on growth track. Revenue has gone up to 72 crores [62 crores in H1 2019-20] and profit has gone up to 7 crores [3.5 crores in H1 2019-20]. With this result we can expect an eps of Rs. 7 in 2020-21.\nStory:\nThe makeover of the company from cotton ginning and cleaning to established suppliers of medicinal supply has been phenomenal. The change in product mix has improved the net profit margin, and despite drop in topline, EBIDT and NP figures have been maintained. Now the company is almost 100% in medicinal supplies. The company is introducing new value-added products on a regular basis where margins can be better.\nThe company is run by Avinash Bansal, a 35-year-old educated person, who personally holds 56% equity in the company. Promoters hold 62.3%, marginal increase in holding on year to year basis. Mr. Mukul Aggrawal, a respected individual investor holds around 8% of the company.\nCash flow figures from operating activity have been encouraging- 14.2 crores in 2019, and 16.2 crores in 2020. The figures give confidence that inventory and receivables are properly managed. Annual interest payment has been reduced from 6.6 crores [2018] to 4.3 crores [2020] showing proper service of debt and some repayment too.\nManagement has guided 20% topline growth in the financial year. Thus, we can estimate a conservatively, based on H1 published results a topline of 150 crores with a net profit of 12 crores in the current financial year. The company is available at a market cap of 40 crores.\nRisk Factors:\nInvesting in micro cap campanies are extremely risky and it can result in loss of 100% invested capital.\nThe products of the company do not have high customer loyalty, and will not result in strong brand value even when successful.\nCompetition from unorganized sector.\nThe thesis of Investment:\nA small growing company which can grow its topline at a decent pace for next many years.\nThe products supplied by the company are largely supplied by unorganized players. With health consciousness, the market share of organized players is likely to improve.\nConfidence is management commentary.\nAttractive valuation- the company is available at 0.6 times book value and 7 PE [4 time 2020-21 estimated eps]\nSuch businesses operate on a better net profit margin. NPM is increasing sequentially for the last 3 years and may increase in the future. Decent margin improvement has been there in H1 2020-21.\nWith topline growth and margin improvement, net profit can grow at a quicker pace.\nWith growth coming back in the current financial year, p/e rerating is possible.\nKindly share your views.\n[Disclosure: Invested]','Mar 4, 2021 7:09 pm'),(1330,296,429,'source of management commentry. thanks','Mar 5, 2021 12:24 pm'),(1331,296,430,'Any reason as to why the secretary, CFO and independent director are resigning in quick succesion?\nWhy is the company doing rating shopping (Crisil, Care then India ratings)?','Mar 5, 2021 1:37 pm'),(1332,296,233,'I am not aware of any such developments.

In next 3-4 years, the management believes the market share of the company in organized market should move towards 50% , around 600,000 MT per year.\nExport Markets… The management believes reckless lending by banks to this sector has been one of the main factors for disrupting the export market.

In recent past, Fy2016 was a challenging year for basmati industry when paddy prices were hammered and the average price range was 18-20 Rs/Kg, and lot of millers and processors got insolvent, but KRBL still maintained its margins and showed growth.\nThe crux of the matter is, this is a ‘Cost plus business’ where the cost of raw material is rupees X and the industry players sell at a margin of 5-7% and branded players like KRBL , LT foods and others sell at a gross margin upwards of 20-25%. So, the cost of paddy produce in the October-November window sets the tone for market prices.\nThe other positives with the company are comfortable Balance sheet position (D/E in the range of 0.65), low cost of funds, robust cash generating profile and most importantly Promoters who have been savvy guardians of the business.','Sep 22, 2016 4:47 pm'),(1442,299,468,'Aditya, what is your opinion on the power business?

Management is very sure that price fluctuation in their flagship brand is going to be almost negligible even with falling underlying paddy prices.\nI completely respect your opinion on Basmati being easily substituted. But IMHO - below points on why I feel that basmati is a unique and rare commodity with no close substitutes:\nMiddle East folks are not going to eat anything other than basmati rice. They have been eating only basmati for generations and will continue to do that. They are basmati rice lovers and will not compromise on the type of rice they eat.\nYou pick India Gate Classic rice packet and you will get same excellent quality all the time regardless of the time of the year. This is why its commands premium pricing for the excellent quality it provides. Such consistent quality builds “brand loyalty” and “customer stickiness” who will pay-up for the quality. KRBL has been very successful in doing this.\nPersonally, I come from a Sindhi family. Our family has not consumed anything other than basmati rice for decades. My dad and uncles are very picky about their basmati rice. They are discerning when it comes to taste, flavor, and aroma of the rice they consume. We still buy basmati rice in bulk (from unorganized retailers - ) and age it for years before we consume it. I can correlate such discerning behavior by Middle East consumers as well other Indian consumers.\nI recommend you to hear quarterly earnings call (if you have not don’e already) and you will realize the value promoters bring to the table. To me - they are street-smart and doing amazing job. They know when to pile up on paddy and when to put brake on it. These are astute businessmen doing this job for more than 4 decades and in rice (or any commodity) business - trust me experience counts more than anything. They are where they are (worth almost $1 billion per today’s market cap) because of the “right” business decisions that they have taken so far.','Mar 9, 2018 11:49 pm'),(1450,299,369,'Guys, has anyone studied the impact of RM vis a vis realization and profit margins over the years here?

If it’s cost plus model, is it cost plus margin%, or cost plus x (x being a fixed number (not percentage))? If it is cost + margin%, then EBITDA% shouldn’t vary much through out the cycle.\nThis looks like an easy to understand business run by good promoters and the business longevity is certain.

INSERT INTO `topicdiscussion` VALUES (1456,299,470,'@paragbharambe - you’re welcome!\nYour “product substitution” is purely competition driven. Buying lower price Kohinoor instead of premium India Gate OR unbranded basmati instead of India Gate; both decisions are driven by lower price. End of the day, both are buying Basmati. And my point of basmati having no substitute goes more into nonbasmati cannot substitute rice. I see unbranded basmati and branded basmati as competitors and not substitutes.\nWill a biryani lover make their biryani with non-basmati rice? There are very high odds that biryani will always be cooked with basmati rice. Hence, IMHO Kohinoor and unbranded basmati are competition of KRBL and not substitutes for basmati rice.\nWhy will Arabs never eat Jasmine (sticky rice) and Chinese never eat Basmati? Because both basmati and jasmine are unique in their own ways. Both are being consumed for generations and its part of the culture and the way traditional local food is made. BTW - I’m not counting on China as big opportunity for Basmati as they will never leave Jasmine. It’s basmati eaters (folks from India, Pak, Middle East) in China will be eating basmati which is being smuggled today from Hong Kong into China.\nHaven’t we heard from great investors that evaluating businesses is more of an art than science. In KRBL’s case - it becomes very important to understand the psychology and behavior patterns of basmati consumers. My personal experience is that basmati consumers are very loyal and don’t mind paying up (versus non-basmati) for better taste and aroma that basmati provides.\nLet’s look at single malt scotch versus blended scotch. Both are scotch but different products with different consumers. Per our topic - single malt is premium basmati and blended scotch is non-basmati. Single malt more expensive than blended. A single malt drinker will not drink blended, if given an option between two. Because single malt is smoother than blended.\nOn a separate note - Basmati’s business model is very similar to premium scotch or premium wine (especially regional as @phreakv6 gave an example of cognac or some French wines which can be grown only in that region to use the trademark name) were aging plays a critical role. And these businesses have got unique and exclusive products for which supply is limited and have growing demand from loyal & unique consumers which may outpace the available supply.\nBasmati rice currently accounts for only ~1% of the total global consumption of rice. Just imagine how high the premium can go if total global consumption of basmati rice becomes 2% (difficult to happen but possible in few years with growing Indian middle class with higher disposable incomes).\nResearching and analyzing Basmati businesses has been challenging because it brings so many qualitative aspects to the table.

Me and a group of other fellow investors were having a discussion around Maruti a few days back brainstorming on what makes Maruti retain its leadership year after year. It evolved into an open ended discussion and we could not conclude on anything except we all agreed that we need to find out if the brand Maruti represents superior cars or is it all the other attributes ( trust, reliability, availability, etc ). I would wager that its the latter. Now, lets see if we could have a blind test for cars. Obviously since the car’s external looks would give it away, what if we had someone like Renault build a replica of any one of Maruti’s models and have Maruti customers drive both vehicles. I would guess that most customers would just take a blind shot.\nEven as far as Fevicol is concerned, i dont think its impossible to develop an adhesive that would be as good as Fevicol or even superior to it. What may be incredibly difficult to do is to build the trust in the minds of the customer. We did have Blue Coat a few years back that was considered to be superior to Fevicol but then Pidilite just bought it out.\nThe point being - if the brand or the competitive edge is just the technicalities of the product ( taste in the case of food products ), its not that difficult for a competitor to take away that edge.

I happened to have some astounding experience with respect to brands up close while working with P&G.\nWith that caveat,\nGSrikan:\nI am curious to know where the “dollar shave club vs Gillette” fits in your analysis.\nI would prefer Dollar shave to Gillette anytime. Gillette is expensive for me. But is that a reflection of a larger undercurrent that brands are no longer a moat? No.\nThese questions keep coming up from time to time, every generation. For instance about 20 years ago a book called No Logo made a big splash in the brand world and outside.\nMy simplistic model of how a brand works is best explained with Daniel Kahneman’s System 1 and System 2 (please refer Thinking, Fast and Slow). We always want to minimize System 2 and maximize System 1 usage. Branding does that, once you, as a consumer, do your System 2 work and decide on a brand, then System 1 takes over. Now if you own the brand, you want it that way for the consumer. The consumer will also not want it interrupted because System 1 will then call System 2 and that is effortful. Especially if you are a woman buying 100 - 150 brands monthly each of them small sums.\nSo System 1 works fine even with minor pricking - ‘it’s OK if Dove is a little costlier now than last year, I don’t know what else is as good’. But if it gets worse and worse like Gillette does for me, I get out of System 1 and get into System 2. It can also happen if there is a compelling proposition that makes System 1 a little alert; ‘people are talking about it; there are so many ads I should try; it’s so cheap that it is worth a try, etc’\nSometimes like in the case of Gillette in my view, institutional imperative takes over and here it is a tendency of the firm to exploit the customer’s trust and lack of choice for improving profits. I know my former employer will not like my saying this, but I find it exorbitant to pay about Rs 700/- for a cartridge of 4 (with the pack saying it was Rs 825, I am giving you a big discount). So there is a case for Dollar Shave Club and others. However this example cannot be extended to say brands have no moat. Because if your brand has System 1 thinking wider / better than your competitor then you have a moat. Which is why knowing ‘unaided recall’ of brands is one of the most important thing to know in market research.\nI don’t know if star rating is a big moat influencer, it must be to some extent but not sure.\nGSrikan:\nIf KRBL’s product is superior, then only it will be able to gain premium.\nProduct superiority has different definitions for different people. So difficult to define for any category what is superiority. For some it could be taste, for some aroma, and for some, something I don’t know. And you cannot put everything without taking price through the roof (a general rule of thumb). So choices will be made. And brand should get that value proposition into System 1 thinking of the consumer, and prevent it from falling into System 2.\nRegards,','Mar 17, 2018 12:17 pm'),(1469,299,167,'diffsoft:\nI don’t know if star rating is a big moat influencer, it must be to some extent but not sure.\nOur lazy System 2 leaves the purchase decisions involving small amounts to System 1 which goes by availability heuritic (ad we may have watched or a review we may have read), inconsistency avoidance (if I bought brand A last time, why should I buy brand B now? Does it mean I made a bad choice last time?) and so on and makes it easy for us. This is the very foundation of brands as you rightly pointed out.\nHowever as @GSrikan pointed out, I see that a lot of modern products are able to build a brand quickly and most times spend less as they can do targeted marketing. Bigger brands survived mostly because they were the only ones that could afford airspace in the prime time. That was their biggest moat. I see social influence plays a bigger part in purchase decisions and a lot of online purchases rely solely on sorting by average customer review (I do it all the time too) and picking one from the top 1 or 2 after reading a few reviews (Very much a System 1 task). This somewhat evens the playing field for quality products that aren’t yet well established to take on big brands through quality and network effect. I think this effect could get bigger and bigger as more of our purchases move online.

They have great products to offer. But, in my opinion, KRBL is a well discovered stock. Over the past couple of years it has garnered a lot of attention. And, when too much attention is showered on a particular stock the pricing becomes fairly efficient. Yet again,in my opinion, such stocks behave like an efficient market. By efficient I mean that everything that’s known to the public is already discounted. The big moves will be due to information flow we are not aware of. That’s purely luck.\nRegarding KRBL’s future growth prospects-\nIn my understanding, as incomes rise, the percentage of calories derived from rice decreases. People can afford different food products.\nBut, I can say with reasonable certainty that in regions where rice consumption is dominant, as disposable income increases there will be some migration to Basmati rice. But,increased Basmati rice consumption doesn’t necessarily mean India gates share of the pie increases.\nA major driver for India Gate will be their customer’s loyalty to it. I don’t see a lot of middle class Indians shifting loyalties to India Gate rice. It’s very expensive for most. For most people all that matters is improving the quality of food they consume. So, if they graduate from a bad rice variety to Basmati that’s more than enough. The brand won’t matter.\nTo summarise- Major drivers will be upper middle class, wealthy who currently are consumers.\nAlso, I strongly believe that they should diversify.\nAnd, it’s good they’re taking steps.

As always, the report illustrates a good framework/checklist (deserves a dedicated thread for discussion). The following is excerpt of an interview (related to India’s EGC report) by Outlook Business with Nitin Bhasin, head of research at Ambit.\nWhat innovation are we seeing in a commodity such as basmati rice?\nInnovation doesn’t necessarily have to revolve around R&D, it could mean doing things differently. The kind of people the company hires, the kind of machinery the company uses, the branding strategy that it adopts and also what unique processes does it follow. In the case of KRBL, innovation can also be seen in its farmer engagement programme. KRBL maintains its own farms to identify the kind of seeds it should be developing for better yields even if there is not enough water. Although it has not entered into contract farming, working with farmers has helped create a strong ecosystem. On the distribution side, it has entered modern trade. It is building a portfolio of multiple brands of rice with different positioning. The KRBL story is not widely known with hardly any institutional investor presence. The whole sector was stereotyped as most rice players ran their businesses in a shoddy manner. KRBL changed the perception. Look at its return on capital employed versus the industry, it clearly stands out. Look at its branding practices versus the industry, it’s different. This is in spite of the fact that KRBL’s product may not be the most expensive compared with peers, but it is more profitable among its peers. KRBL has complete control on its production process — right from power, raw materials to the farmer. At the same time, it is focusing on making the balance-sheet better. The story for KRBL began when it developed a seed with better productivity — the rice that came out from the seed was of a superior quality and found wider acceptance.

So as far as products in the rice industry goes, I might be more interested in tractors, seeds or basic farm equipment. In the rice exporting space, I might be more inclined towards basic rice variants and not Basmati.\nThe only exception is if the product is primarily targeted towards wealthy people. An example would be Eicher Motors. The affluent do not care about percentage point changes in inflation. They are buying the product for its aesthetic appeal or bragging rights. This makes the product partially recession proof.\nI have not done market research or anything to see if customers of Basmati rice have started looking at it as a necessity rather than a luxury.

With the money it gets from the sale and with no more investment to be done on power assets, the free cash flow would be very good for future business expansion (ex: for aquiring Rice NPA assets, to invest in inventory based aged kollam rice business etc.)\n(Can anybody caclulate, what will be ROCE & ROE of agri business i.e. excluding power division?)\nThe GST & easing of demonetization induced cash sqeeze, made domestic business suffer.

The increased realizations would offset those costs but not as much as in low inventory cost environment. The high procurement cost scenario is the scenario which favors the financially strong companies to gain market share over not financially strong competition.\nI am not sure how much inventory from last season are still left with KRBL but the old low priced inventory may provide some more support to ebidta margins for couple of more quarters.\nShort term -ves:\nNot much of visibility over how Iran sanctions effect would turn out to be for Basmati players (even if sanctions wont apply on food items like Basmati, the banks being sanctions would affect the money flow causing disruptions).\nThe current valuations of 24 PE for inventory heavy business like KRBL would still not leave too much of margin of safety for investor.\nNeed to watch out how the new businesses (quinoa, chia, flax etc) would work.\nNeed to watch out the effects of newly procured high priced paddy on this year’s and next year’s profit margins and return rations.\nDiscl: I don’t have much expertise in investing or in Basmati rice industry.

This is demonstrated by the steady decline in the percentage of inventory funded through external debt from around 66% as on March 31, 2014 to 47% as on March 31, 2018.\nThe inventory, valued at cost, also carries a pricing premium in light of the increase in Basmati rice prices, both in the domestic and international markets.\nIran, one of the leading importers of Basmati rice from India, intermittently imposes import ban which affects the demand and pricing dynamics. In this fiscal, there is the added risk of trade sanctions onIran by the US, which can impact supply to that country.\nAnother growing risk for the industry is the tightening of pesticide residual norms by importing countries.

Assuming that KRBLs business keeps growing at 12% CAGR, I tried to picture the owner’s FCF. I looked at your screen shot and subtracted net debt from incremental inventory to come up with inventory funded through internal accruals. Additionally, I added back dividends to this number. Then to consider for the 3-4 year cycle. I took avg FCF for 2011-13 and 17-19 which range from 70 Cr to 400 Cr with around 20 % growth.

I will not be able to share my view on the future regarding impact of this geopolitical tension on the basmati industry or KRBL. In fact, personally I would not even take Mr. Anil Mittal’s future view on this topic since its so delicate and sensitive that I believe no one can predict how things will pan out. This reminds me famous quote by Bruce Newberg - “There’s a big difference between probability and outcome. Probable things fail to happen - and improbable things happen - all the time.”\nHowever, I would look at two indicators 1) look at the history and take cues from it to check how things materialized in the past. 2) where are we in the existing basmati cycle today to determine whether to be aggressive with accumulation OR stand back and let market/cycle come to your comfortable price.\nSanctions on Iran or geopolitical issues in the middle east have always been an issue in the past. However, their appetite for basmati has grown year after year and KRBL has flourished with it. Will this continue in the future? I believe so. Currently Iran consumes 3.2mn MT of basmati annually out of which it produces 1.8-1.9mn MT and imports rest. They have no option but to import to cover their short-fall. Pakistan produces about 600k MT. India’s production is 6mn MT. Pakistan doesn’t have capacity to fulfill Iran’s full demand. Iran doesn’t have any option but to come to India. Mr. Mittal has indicated before that worst-case Iran business will go through Dubai or Iraq. So long story short - there can be short-term Iran demand issues given trade bans or US sanctions, but I believe there is a good chance if someone is holding for long-term this event would be a small blip in the bigger scheme of things.\nMr. Mittal has already candidly shared that this year they are expecting good basmati crop which in itself should keep prices in check. On top of this if Iran demand is slow/less - then that will add further pressure to basmati prices.\nIn the bigger scheme of things - recent opportunistic aggressive purchases by promoters of 8.4 lac shares valued roughly at 20cr shows confidence by management that it is truly confident that Tax & ED issues will be resolved in KRBL’s favour and it is bullish in long-term prospects of the business. Mr. Mittal also indicated in one of his interviews that management is mulling over demerging energy business. If this happens, it’s balance-sheet will show the asset-light quality of Agri business plus 30%+ ROIC of Agri business which may lead to re-rating.\nDisc: invested for long-term and will be buying at attractive levels.

For me, if a company is not increasing it’s Net Cash Flow along with it’s Net Income, then it’s a big red flag.\nOCF not matching Net Income is a valid concern for any business and not just KRBL. KRBL is a unique business with some Business Intricacies that one need to be aware of to better understand the business. These intricacies are like 1) Basmati procurement period 2) Aging Process 3) Inventory increase and decrease season 4) Underlying basmati pricing cycle 5) etc. Each investor in KRBL should have a good grasp on all these important intricacies.\nNow let me try to address your OCF not matching with NI concern. Basmati is grown only once a year. Paddy procurement period is limited between Oct-Dec. And KRBL ages its paddy for mostly 2 years because aged basmati is premium product because of its taste, flavour, and aroma. Hence KRBL commands better margins compared to other peers. So in b/s of March you are going to see increase in inventory because of paddy that was procured in Oct-Dec. If you see their b/s that they share end of September every year, you will notice drastic decrease in inventory where older aged basmati is being sold and new basmati is again procured in Oct-Dec increasing your inventory (see how inventory moves in screenshot that @madhug has shared above). In order to grow they have to increase volume and hence their inventory goes up every year. Hence, increase in inventory puts pressure on their OCF. If they were to release their annual statements in September instead of March, Cash Flows would have looked very different.\nI presented my understanding of KRBL’s business at 2019 VP Annual Goa meet.

This does not seem ideal to me as the avg for last 10 years is around 270 and cash conversion cycle for recent years has been 20% higher than avg which tells me that either KRBL is not able to convert inventory into sales efficiently or they are anticipating higher demand.\nIn your Inventory Days Outstanding, your numerator is your present inventory but your denominator COGS is of 1.5-2 years old. Inventory value has been steadily moving up, but COGS will be volatile given lower procurement cost in some years compared to higher procurement cost in other years. Hence the output of this ratio is not very helpful to me if I look at it alone.\nabhishekshete:\n1.2 The below image was taken from your presentation and you can see that change is inventory is not necessarily highest when the avg paddy cost are lowest. Check year 2014 where management spent 430 crore on additional inventory when prices were 38 Rs/kg. Similary in 2019.\nI suggest you to not look at inventory alone. Dive little deeper. Track volume and cost of inventory that is being procured to get complete picture. 1000kg of inventory procured at Rs. 10 makes Rs. 10,000 worth of inventory. But 769kg procured at Rs. 13 also makes inventory worth Rs. 10,000. They have always procured more volume of paddy at lower prices and have been very aggressive when prices are lower.\nFrom below screenshot you can see that they aggressively procured paddy in FY15 and rice in FY16 when prices were lower. So my point is tracking only change in inventory without looking at ongoing paddy prices, volume procured, etc is not of much use (at least to me). Looking at everything together should give you a better view.\nabhishekshete:\n1.3 The reason I dont see demand is that inventory turnover is at all time low. I can understand if management is trying to procure the low cost paddy for future demand but that doesnt seem to be the case, they seem to have been buying paddy at above avg rates where as they are not able to make the necessary sale to efficiently manage that inventory.\nSame as above for inventory turnover. If they were not making necessary sale to efficiently manage their inventory, they would not have funded 1008cr worth of WC through internal accruals in last 8 years. Their inventory levels have gone up 4x but Net Debt level has gone up only 2x. Look at slide #12 of my deck to better get what I am trying to say.\nabhishekshete:\nWhile I agree that additional working capital is helping the business grow, practically KRBL wouldnt be able to stop adding more inventory year on year until they become of huge scale after which it would be difficult to grow their sales and manage inventory of say 7000 crs with sales around 8,000-9,000 cr. in which case, I would assume that I will be hardly getting any free cash flows as an owner for say 50-100 cr every year for next 10 years and then maybe they start generating free cash flows of 800-900 crs assuming growth will be around 10% for next 10 years and 1% after.\nAt 7000cr worth of inventory in my view they would do top-line of ~14000cr in bad year and ~18000cr in a good year. This is longgggg-way away for now.\nI don’t look at FCF for “equity owner” for valuation but I look at “owner earnings”. For example - if KRBL is generating 500cr worth of OCF and 400cr goes towards funding inventory (assuming zero CAPEX), your FCF is 100cr. So you will value the business based of 100cr. But your business has made 500cr and out of which 400cr is ploughed back, earning good ROIC, which is going to increase your business’ intrinsic value. So why should I use only 100cr as my FCF? I am going to value the business based on it’s “owner earnings”. If tomorrow, KRBL management is happy with the scale that they have reached or there is no incremental growth opportunity left, with current inventory levels KRBL on average will keep throwing 500cr cash at you annually. So why should we ignore 400cr worth of earnings for valuation purposes that is ploughed back for future growth. Another example - Tasty Bite Eatable has generated ~155cr worth of OCF in last 10 years and ~135cr of CAPEX. That leaves only 20cr of FCF in last 10 years. It has every year ploughed back money back in business for future growth leaving almost nothing as FCF. Look at the wealth that this business has generated and one would have not valued it properly if one only looked at FCF for valuation purposes.\nMy central point which I know you have read it before (from Mr. Buffett’s Owner Earnings concept) here is that its safe to treat incremental CAPEX and WC used to generate the growth in business as Owner Earnings/FCFE - as long as you understand the business, trust management, and you have good confidence in its future prospects. Cash spent on CAPEX and WC to grow the business is ultimately going to bring more cash which will be again deployed to grow the business and the cycle will continue forever until management sees growth prospect. It will be good if these investments are funded from internally generated funds or minimal debt. If funded full with debt, then one should be very cautious and skeptical. IMHO - one needs to treat this cash portion differently which is spent towards growth of the business.\nabhishekshete:\n(Note - I read through your understanding of additional working capital being part of the owner’s earnings but while I think it does help the business grow, I as an owner do not see visibility to get my hands on that cashflow as a shareholder for a very long time)\nOne shouldn’t need cash in their hand from a business that is generating >25-30% ROIC. KRBL’s agri business is generating excellent ROIC. Let them plough back OCF to agri business and grow the intrinsic value of the business. Monitor their capital allocation. If they put money in activities which are not ROE accretive, one should pull out. Else, one should happily ride until captital allocation is appropriate and future growth story is in-tact.\nabhishekshete:\nWhile current valuation is still cheaper than the picture painted above, my question is, how else would you value such business other than DCF?\nWhat does your scenario for future cashflows look like?\nSomeone asked Buffett how does he value a business. Buffett replied that the value of a business is the present value of all CFs that it will generate from now until the eternity. Munger was in the same room and he tried to pull Buffett’s leg by saying that he has never seen Buffett do DCF. Buffett wittingly replied that there are some things that one should do only privately and DCF happens to be one of those things. This I heard in one of the CFA India webinars by Rajeev Thakkar and I believe this is a true story.\nSo instead of doing DCF by using my assumptions, I try to do reverse DCF using today’s stock price to see what is that market is implying at current stock price. I highly recommend you to read Expectation Investing by Micheal Mauboussin to get a new valuation weapon.\nDue to tax and ED issues overhang in last 1-1.5 years, KRBL stock price has been languishing such that I didn’t need to pull out my excel spreadsheet for it’s valuation. Just with simple back of envelope calculation, one could had figured out that one was not paying anything for growth for all this time, in my view.

Also almost 1/4th of their capex was invested into this segment, it seems like they are now back-tracking on it. Conversely, why don’t they spend on advertising and marketing instead to take on the other players (backed by known brand ambassadors)\nDependence on Middle east: Still feel that their dependance on the middle east may cause a supply-demand mismatch and may possible affect their major revenue streams. Would be interesting to know how many Indian households actually end up consuming basmati rice. Recently did a store visit to purchase basmati rice, and retailers were not too picky on which brand they recommended\nWould love to hear views on the above points.','May 11, 2014 6:08 pm'),(1598,299,470,'It’s Middle East and not India the biggest market of basmati rice. In FY 2015-16, Saudi Arabia, Iran, United Arab Emirates and Iraq accounted for a majority of India’s Basmati Rice exports with 23%, 17%, 15% and 10% share respectively. India Gate Classic SKU market in India is only 10,000 MT whereas its market is 40,000 MT overseas (most of it in Middle East). Management is very sure that price fluctuation in their flagship brand is going to be almost negligible even with falling underlying paddy prices.\nI completely respect your opinion on Basmati being easily substituted. But IMHO - below points on why I feel that basmati is a unique and rare commodity with no close substitutes:\nMiddle East folks are not going to eat anything other than basmati rice. They have been eating only basmati for generations and will continue to do that. They are basmati rice lovers and will not compromise on the type of rice they eat.\nYou pick India Gate Classic rice packet and you will get same excellent quality all the time regardless of the time of the year. This is why its commands premium pricing for the excellent quality it provides. Such consistent quality builds “brand loyalty” and “customer stickiness” who will pay-up for the quality. KRBL has been very successful in doing this.\nPersonally, I come from a Sindhi family. Our family has not consumed anything other than basmati rice for decades. My dad and uncles are very picky about their basmati rice. They are discerning when it comes to taste, flavor, and aroma of the rice they consume. We still buy basmati rice in bulk (from unorganized retailers - ) and age it for years before we consume it. I can correlate such discerning behavior by Middle East consumers as well other Indian consumers.\nI recommend you to hear quarterly earnings call (if you have not don’e already) and you will realize the value promoters bring to the table. To me - they are street-smart and doing amazing job. They know when to pile up on paddy and when to put brake on it. These are astute businessmen doing this job for more than 4 decades and in rice (or any commodity) business - trust me experience counts more than anything. They are where they are (worth almost $1 billion per today’s market cap) because of the “right” business decisions that they have taken so far.','May 11, 2014 6:08 pm'),(1599,299,369,'Guys, has anyone studied the impact of RM vis a vis realization and profit margins over the years here?

If it’s cost plus model, is it cost plus margin%, or cost plus x (x being a fixed number (not percentage))? If it is cost + margin%, then EBITDA% shouldn’t vary much through out the cycle.\nThis looks like an easy to understand business run by good promoters and the business longevity is certain. There is certainly some moat, which comes with Basmati cultivation confined to an area and brand power.\nDisclaimer: Tracking','May 11, 2014 6:08 pm'),(1600,299,167,'It very much looks like a cost plus model to me.

This has not happened so far but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the future. This is where the management’s decades of experience should come into play to predict when is the right time to build their inventory.\nHowever, a commodity-like supply glut leading to crash in prices (like Sugar or Copper) doesn’t seem possible here as the area under cultivation is more or less same and grows at a predictable rate and the production is very much predictable and being protected by “Geographical Indicated” moniker (like Cognac or some French wines which can be grown only in that region to use the trademark name), it can only be cultivated in the foothills of the Indo-Gangetic plain to be called “basmati”.

It evolved into an open ended discussion and we could not conclude on anything except we all agreed that we need to find out if the brand Maruti represents superior cars or is it all the other attributes ( trust, reliability, availability, etc ). I would wager that its the latter. Now, lets see if we could have a blind test for cars. Obviously since the car’s external looks would give it away, what if we had someone like Renault build a replica of any one of Maruti’s models and have Maruti customers drive both vehicles. I would guess that most customers would just take a blind shot.\nEven as far as Fevicol is concerned, i dont think its impossible to develop an adhesive that would be as good as Fevicol or even superior to it. What may be incredibly difficult to do is to build the trust in the minds of the customer. We did have Blue Coat a few years back that was considered to be superior to Fevicol but then Pidilite just bought it out.\nThe point being - if the brand or the competitive edge is just the technicalities of the product ( taste in the case of food products ), its not that difficult for a competitor to take away that edge.

We always want to minimize System 2 and maximize System 1 usage. Branding does that, once you, as a consumer, do your System 2 work and decide on a brand, then System 1 takes over. Now if you own the brand, you want it that way for the consumer. The consumer will also not want it interrupted because System 1 will then call System 2 and that is effortful. Especially if you are a woman buying 100 - 150 brands monthly each of them small sums.\nSo System 1 works fine even with minor pricking - ‘it’s OK if Dove is a little costlier now than last year, I don’t know what else is as good’. But if it gets worse and worse like Gillette does for me, I get out of System 1 and get into System 2. It can also happen if there is a compelling proposition that makes System 1 a little alert; ‘people are talking about it; there are so many ads I should try; it’s so cheap that it is worth a try, etc’\nSometimes like in the case of Gillette in my view, institutional imperative takes over and here it is a tendency of the firm to exploit the customer’s trust and lack of choice for improving profits. I know my former employer will not like my saying this, but I find it exorbitant to pay about Rs 700/- for a cartridge of 4 (with the pack saying it was Rs 825, I am giving you a big discount). So there is a case for Dollar Shave Club and others. However this example cannot be extended to say brands have no moat. Because if your brand has System 1 thinking wider / better than your competitor then you have a moat. Which is why knowing ‘unaided recall’ of brands is one of the most important thing to know in market research.\nI don’t know if star rating is a big moat influencer, it must be to some extent but not sure.\nGSrikan:\nIf KRBL’s product is superior, then only it will be able to gain premium.\nProduct superiority has different definitions for different people. So difficult to define for any category what is superiority. For some it could be taste, for some aroma, and for some, something I don’t know. And you cannot put everything without taking price through the roof (a general rule of thumb). So choices will be made. And brand should get that value proposition into System 1 thinking of the consumer, and prevent it from falling into System 2.\nRegards,','May 11, 2014 6:08 pm'),(1611,299,476,'Yes, i concur that it is well discovered stock, valuation wise it is not compelling buy as it was earlier, however i may be wrong here or underestimated to understand the theme.

Following are my observations.\nThe GST seems have had big disruption in Company’s momentum of gaining market share from unorganized sector, which has gained significantly post demonetisation, The transition is not smooth as lot of retailers do not want to come under GST. Another disadvantage seems to 5% GST compared to 0% GST on private labels. Management feels 5% difference in price may not sway the customer much.\nIran imports were supposed to start mid Nov post lift of import ban. There was a big disruption in Iran due to one super sized import for private label, which caused lot chaos. The exporters seem to have taken 30% haircut when the payments happened (dont remember exactly which quarter this happened). Exporter is not KRBL. KRBL now does not sell any unbranded Basmati except for Govt tenders which are backed by proper security.\nCompany is trying hard to gain market share in US & Canada (where I believe LT foods is No 1). This market is growing at 12% and KRBL is growing more than 12% indicating they are gaining market share.\nCompany is trying to expand exports to countries like Africa, Brazil, Europe.\nBasmati Seeds market share is 32-35% (since last 3 yrs). Govt is also supplying Basmati seeds at cheaper price. Though management claims KRBL’s seeds are superior with 99.98% germination rate.\nKRBL is first company to have got clearance for imports from China. Management expected it to be big market around Dec 2016 quarter. In recent times, they are not optimistic about China market. They say this is due to political reasons.\nAbt 2 years back there was unprecedented fall in basmati paddy prices to upto 21/Kg. KRBL bought huge amount of rice as it was in comfortable financial position & KRBL is the only company which ages rice in more than 2 yrs aging category. This low cost inventory is still helping KRBL in big EBITDA margins.\nThis year Paddy prices are very high 31-32/Kg & may reach or exceed 35-36/kg. This will help in better realizations in export as well as doemestic sales. As prices are high, KRBL will procure less rice as it still has good amount of inventory. Every year price rises, the following year there will be too much supply and prices would fall eventually. This cycle is repeating since 45 years with one very recent exception of two year high prices.\nNo more investments in Power sector. No specific plans for sale of the power assets though they do not reject the idea of selling.\nSAP fully implemented to track demand & supply from retailers (?) & distributors. They are using big data analytics to improve the sales.\nThe advertising budget is same as LT foods which is close to 40 crores.\nPlease correct me if there are inaccuracies in my statements.

As always, the report illustrates a good framework/checklist (deserves a dedicated thread for discussion). The following is excerpt of an interview (related to India’s EGC report) by Outlook Business with Nitin Bhasin, head of research at Ambit.\nWhat innovation are we seeing in a commodity such as basmati rice?\nInnovation doesn’t necessarily have to revolve around R&D, it could mean doing things differently. The kind of people the company hires, the kind of machinery the company uses, the branding strategy that it adopts and also what unique processes does it follow. In the case of KRBL, innovation can also be seen in its farmer engagement programme. KRBL maintains its own farms to identify the kind of seeds it should be developing for better yields even if there is not enough water. Although it has not entered into contract farming, working with farmers has helped create a strong ecosystem. On the distribution side, it has entered modern trade. It is building a portfolio of multiple brands of rice with different positioning. The KRBL story is not widely known with hardly any institutional investor presence. The whole sector was stereotyped as most rice players ran their businesses in a shoddy manner. KRBL changed the perception. Look at its return on capital employed versus the industry, it clearly stands out. Look at its branding practices versus the industry, it’s different. This is in spite of the fact that KRBL’s product may not be the most expensive compared with peers, but it is more profitable among its peers. KRBL has complete control on its production process — right from power, raw materials to the farmer. At the same time, it is focusing on making the balance-sheet better. The story for KRBL began when it developed a seed with better productivity — the rice that came out from the seed was of a superior quality and found wider acceptance. But the company did not just engage merely in product innovation, but innovated its processes as well.\nSource: https://www.outlookbusiness.com/markets/interview/look-out-for-companies-aspiring-to-dominate-niche-businesses-4215 55','May 11, 2014 6:08 pm'),(1615,299,479,'Dear Dinesh,\nHi, this is amit agarwal again.\nIf you have read MPs book,the dhando investor…he is very much using DCF for ratifying his investment rationale.

The real strength of a brand is in its pull which drives its topline even though it may be at a lower rate.\nIn case of KRBL as figures reveal, in March 2014 topline was 2910 crores and in subsequent years the figure is 3200, 3300, 3150, 3250 crores.

This is demonstrated by the steady decline in the percentage of inventory funded through external debt from around 66% as on March 31, 2014 to 47% as on March 31, 2018.\nThe inventory, valued at cost, also carries a pricing premium in light of the increase in Basmati rice prices, both in the domestic and international markets.\nIran, one of the leading importers of Basmati rice from India, intermittently imposes import ban which affects the demand and pricing dynamics. In this fiscal, there is the added risk of trade sanctions onIran by the US, which can impact supply to that country.\nAnother growing risk for the industry is the tightening of pesticide residual norms by importing countries. The European Union has already imposed stringent norms with effect from January 1, 2018. Saudi Arabia (another leading Basmati rice importer from India) is also considering the same.

Microsec seems to have experimented on a couple of business ideas and has zero-ed in on e-pharmacy business after seeing good initial traction. The listed entity converted itself from an NBFC into a Core Investment Company (holding company) and the main business is that of its subsidiary called SastaSundar HealthBuddy Pvt Ltd\nAbout the Business (model):\nSastaSundar operates in primarily the e-pharmacy space (84% of their revenues are from medicines; rest is from OTC/ FMCG products like green tea, sugar free snacks, hebal mouthwash, baby products etc). Their vision is to become a holistic healthcare network (network of doctors, telemedicine/ online consultations, knowledgebase of healthcare etc)\nOn the core business of epharmacy: They aggregate demand by attracting consumers digitally – primarily mobile app - (by giving a 15% discount (cost) and by home delivering the medicines (convenience). The target segment is the chronic patients (90% of their orders are medicines for chronic diseases like diabetes, blood pressure, cardio etc). This segment gives the best value prop for the consumer/patient since savings of Rs 300 on a Rs 2000 monthly regular purchase is a significant value.\nThe basic model is an inventory led model (warehouse) where medicines are procured at bulk rates from distributors/ manufacturers (could be 30% to 40% less than the retail prices – pharma margins are high as we know). Of this they share 15% back to the consumer as discount). The rest is divided between the HealthBuddy/Pharmacist and SastaSundar.\nPrivate Labels: On the FMCG products, they seem to be launching their own private label brands – this will give them high margins over the long term.\nCurrent Financials:\nCurrently the company is loss making (remember it’s a startup). They did Revenue of 86 Cr in FY16. In H1 of 2017, they have done Revenue of 76 Cr – so the growth has been rapid. Since it’s a startup, we won’t be able to able to do much financial analysis in the traditional sense. What would matter would be unit economics and breakeven timelines – and that they don’t burn money on customer acquisition and discounting.\nCompetitive landscape:\nThere are half a dozen well funded startups in the space. In terms of funding, NetMeds has led the pack (has taken $50m) , but in terms of a pure startup 1mg seems to be the leader (Close on their heels are companies like Pharmeasy, LifCare and Myra). All of these are well funded by well known VCs (http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/vcs-new-playground-is-online-pharma/55846201 6)\nRisks:\nRegulatory risk is very high as epharmacies operate in a grey area. Snapdeal got arrest warrants from FDA for selling medicines without a proper license. But the central government is supporting the epharmacy industry and looks like will come out with some sort of regulation in a few years (lot of news articles can be found regarding the same).\nOffline players Lobby risk: The retail pharmacists fear that epharmacy will do to them what Flipkart and Amazon did to their retail counterparts and are heavily lobbying against the epharmacy industry. So this could delay the regulation, though in the long run the regulation will come. Given the political nexus in the pharma distribution business this could be more serious than what meets the eye.\nExpansion/ Execution risk: SastaSundar has been able to execute this well in Kolkata. It remains to be seen if they will be able to replicate this model in other states. Especially given the well funded competitors who are strong in their cities/states where they started, this has to be closely watched on a quarterly basis.\nUnit economics Sustainability: The company has mentioned that it would be profitable by FY18. This needs to be carefully watched on a quarterly basis. EBITDA has come down from -30% in Sep 15, to -15% in Sep 2016, so the trend is good.\nValuation:\nSince the company is yet to breakeven, we cannot value the company using P/E. A more suitable approach would be GMV multiple that’s typically applied to an early stage ecommerce startup. On that basis this is around a multiple of 1 time the Sales, which appears low. Given the good repeat rates (around 80%), which makes it like a subscription business, and high margins of the pharma retail industry (aided by the multiple private label products launched), a valuation of 5 times Revenue looks reasonable at this stage if the growth momentum continues. The potential market size is quite large (Rs 1 lakh crores pharma sales in India in 2016; epharmacy is nascent and has huge headroom for growth). Risks around execution, especially around expansion outside home state of West Bengal; strong competition from multiple well funded players and; regulatory risks remain and could be priced into the stock.\nDisclosure: have entered in this quarter with exposure around 10% of portfolio.

Camphor can be produced in 2 ways:\n1. Natural Production: Made from the wood of Camphor tree, mostly found in Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam. With the growing known uses of camphor in chemical industries, Japan raised the prices in the late 19th century. This eventually led to the development of synthetic camphor. Camphor made through camphor wood gives a paltry yield.\n2. Synthetic camphor: Was developed in the early 20th century. Much cheaper and scalable. Produced from Pine tree which is abundantly available. Gives a yield of about 90%.\nAlthough India has abundant pine tree but the output from India variety is just 17% compared to 80% from the imported variety. This explains the import of turpentine for these Camphor companies.\nProduction through synthetic route is at a fraction of cost and available abundantly.\nNatural camphor price is at least 3x of Synthetic camphor.\nTechnical grade(93-94% purity)- Used in Puja\nPharmaceutical grade(98% purity)- Used in pharma\nThe industry is asset light, without the use of any technology implying very little barriers of entry.

We did not understand the demand side factors well enough. We assumed a turn in the capex cycle but it did not materialise because of various factors. Oil capex was poor because of collapse in prices, nuclear did not take off because of government inaction, and the rest of the industry didn’t spend because growth continued to be poor and companies were debt-laden. One key lesson is never buy a business when the underlying has got huge inflation built in. Even though WPIL was a pump company, its demand was dictated to an extent by oil prices and the softening of oil prices impacted its business.

Some of the key points I noted during the AGM:\n• One of the major reasons for improvement in margins during FY19 is supplying of large, value added pumps where we also did designing.\n• In domestic markets, company expects higher investment on municipal and irrigation side. Even the business environment in Middle East is improving. Furthermore, the nuclear market has started reviving.\n• During FY19, we supplied a large submersible pump of 30 MW (one of the largest to be installed in the country) for Telangana project.\n• Post acquisition of Finder Pumps, we are able to cover largely all the major areas in the pump segments. We are much more diversified now and not dependent on any sector. Finder gives us an entry into high end Oil & Gas pumps which is USD 10 billion market and growing rapidly. It is currently present in downstream refinery market and major demand is for replacement only. Last year Finder did revenue of USD 30 million with EBITDA margins of 11%. We plan to increase it to our current margins (around 15 – 20%). Furthermore, Finder’s plant is just 20 miles away from our existing plant of Aturia. We think there can be significant synergies between both the companies. No other Indian company has presence in oil & gas pump space. One of the largest companies in the oil & gas space is Flowserve Inc which had sales of USD 2 billion in the segment.\n• Advances given to Hindustan Udyog Limited? WPIL has given advances for the acquisition of the unit but labour force at the unit has entered into a litigation against the sale. Hindustan Udyog has better and larger facility than our existing units and Nagpur (location of unit) has better accessibility for shipping our pumps compared to Kolkata unit. The unit is an important part for our growth plans. The valuation of Hindustan Udyog Limited has been done by independent valuation companies.\n• Current order book in domestic market is Rs.1100 crore while for subsidiaries, its 700 crore plus. Consolidated order book is Rs.1800 crore. We have been very judicious in order book and only book contracts where funding for project is cleared. Current order book doesn’t include Cameroon project of EUR 52 million as funding for the project is yet to be secured by its Government. Expect the funding for the project to be completed in next 2 quarters. We don’t have any outstanding order from Telangana government.\n• We are looking to sell Mathers actively.\n• Performance of subsidiary in Thailand was impacted due to elections in the country. Thse year expect the performance to improve.\n• Last year saw significant growth for us in terms of revenue and profitability. We target to growth it this year as well not withstanding quarterly fluctuations due to lumpiness in our business. We target to grow revenue and profitability these year as well. Most of our businesses have stabilized.\n• On margins, we continue to target 15% plus margins. Given our product complexity and lower cost structures, margins are higher. One of the reasons for higher margins for us is the service business that we do which is a high margin segment.\n• We are a strong player in project business in domestic and global markets. We are one of the strongest players in the industry to capitalize on the water opportunity emerging due to Government’s thrust. We are present in all the segments in water including piped water, irrigation, river linking etc.\n• In exports, while working in markets like Africa, we work for projects either funded through Government directly or through multilateral agencies like World Bank etc. However, we only start working on the project if entire funding for the project is secured.\n• We have been continuously reducing debt. Currently, debt has increased to Rs.120 crore in Q1FY20 due to Finder acquisition. We continue to increase dividends too.\n• In India and Africa we are present in engineered pump division, conventional pump division and infrastructure (EPC division) while in Europe and other markets we are largely doing engineered pumps and conventional pumps. Europe is largely focussed on oil & gas and nuclear segment.\n• We have strong operational CEO across our global subsidiaries. We have 1000 employees working for us (including off roll employees). 550 of them are in India while remaining are at our global locations.\n• We have been extremely judicious in writing off our bad debts in past and will continue in future as well. We have infact recovered some of our bad debts.\n• In nuclear markets, we are one of the biggest player globally and it’s a difficult market to crack. It takes 10 years to build a nuclear power plant.\n• Are we looking for any further acquisition? Not in the near to medium term. We are present across segments now with acquisition of Finder.\n• We have improved our balance sheet a lot over the past 3 years. As a company while bidding for orders we are first focussed on cash flows, profitability margins and last on revenue.\n• Reason for reducing stake in Aturia International to 61% from 76% in FY17? At that time, WPIL was facing liquidity issues and our international subsidiaries were bleeding. The promoters had to infuse liquidity in Aturia directly and increase their stake.

It’s a business that has high stickiness because of the customized nature of the orders for felts combined with other allied factors (machine manufacturer, assembler, etc.).\nThe industry brings together two components – subscription + Goldminer phenomenon.\nIt is a business whose fortunes are decoupled from that of its customers – paper manufacturers have cyclical issues, raw material issues, etc. Also given the consumable nature of the product, repeat orders at frequent intervals are required. Combined with the stickiness, this brings in an element of subscription.\nThey are linked directly with the capacity of the industry. Unless there is a major change in the way paper is made, there is no threat to the product. As the business and margins are steady coupled with the fact that the cost of raw materials is also low, (based on how the company’s affairs are managed) it is a highly profitable business. Given all this, it is a low volatility way of compounding over long periods. (Definitely no 10 baggers here. But a See’s Candies type is possible).\nWhat Are Paper Felts And Fabrics?\nSince paper felts and fabrics are products that we’re not used to seeing often, it’s not very intuitive to understand what exactly the product is and does. It’s better to break it down into smaller questions.\nQ1. What are these felts/fabrics?\nFelts and fabric layers are primarily used in the paper industry. They perform 2 roles main – absorb water and act as conveyors. There are certain specific functions that they perform based on where they are used (we’ll get to that in the next question). It is a consumable in the process of production of paper. Paper manufacturing cannot take place without it.\nQ2. Where is it used in the process of paper manufacturing?\nPapermaking can broadly be broken down into 3 stages – pulping, paper making, and finishing.\nPulping (where the pulp is made)\nDebark logs\nChipping\nChemical pulping (breaking down lignin – an organic polymer)\nFinal pulp (a thicker, less refined version of paper)\nPaper Making (where the paper is made (no points there))\nSheet formation (the fibers spread out and take the form of a think sheet)\nPress section (fed into press section at 90 KMPH to squeeze out 50% of water).\nDryer (the paper is run over cast iron cylinders heated up to 100 degrees Celsius with the felt in-between)\nFinishing (finishing is not made but created on the paper surface)\nCalendering\nWinding\nIt’s in the second stage where felts play a critical role. They essentially absorb the water in different stages and act as conveyors.\nBased on the above, you can link the different types of fabrics to their respective sections:\nForming Fabric – for the forming section\nPress Fabric – wet paper application in the Press section\nDryer Fabric – for the dryer sections (no points for guessing)\nRoll Covers, QualiFlex sleeves for shoe press, and Doctor Blades – Stage 2/3 application\nSource: Valmet\nSource: Multicopy\nImages to be read left to right\nIf you’re like me and are looking into all this for the first time, it helps to be able to see all this. Here is a video that could help you visualize this: Papermaking process 6\n(More resources are available at the end)\nQ3. What are felts and fabrics made of?\nIn the old days, metallic screens were used to drain out water. With the advent of mechanized paper manufacturing, there was a transition towards wool/yarn/cotton while also using metallic screens/wires. With the rise of synthetic materials, felts are largely made of polyester or nylon fabrics with some addition or wool or yarn in certain segments. These materials help provide – better efficiency (in draining water – we’re talking of managing 100,000 liters of pulp per minute), higher life (they are used in an extreme pressure situation where machines are working under extreme heat (150oC-500oC), speed (2-2.5km per minute) and force) and better and more consistent sheet quality.\nQ4. How frequently are they replaced?\nGiven that they are used in extreme stress environments, based on which section they are used in, they last between a few days to a year and a half.\nSource: Albany International Investor Presentation\nFelts are highly machine and use specific. Thus, they are customized to a very large extent. If an issue is found or some level of wear and tear beyond acceptance is noticed, the fabric must be replaced immediately otherwise it impacts the quality of the paper.\nLarge companies pour resources into R&D focusing on improving the life of the product. However, there are limits to how much it can be extended and this isn’t a very big/major risk (the above figures have barely crept up in the past 2 decades).\nQ5. How much do felts cost?\n“A paper machine costs several hundred million dollars to build which makes the cost of downtime very high. Therefore, efficient operation of the machine is extremely important which demands high quality fabrics with long life at high speeds and harsh environmental conditions such as high temperature, tension and humidity. Depending on the size of the paper machine, the cost of one complete set of clothing on a sizable machine can be approximately a million dollars.”\nPaper Machine Clothing by Sabit Adanur 5\nBefore we move onto the next section, let’s take stock of the main takeaways:\nHighly critical component (manufacturing literally cannot take place without it)\nConsumable used under extreme stress environments (cannot be recycled or reused. New line need to be put) in 3 sub-stages - Forming, Pressing, and Drying.\nMade of synthetic material (monofilament polymers)\nMade to order based on customer requirement (machine, type of paper being manufactured, process, etc.)\nCosts negligible compared to the output.\nNow that we’ve understood what the product is and how it’s used, let’s move onto the next section of understand the macro view of the product.\nThe Macro View\nThe Global paper felt/fabric industry is estimated to be around $2 Billion based on data points from 10K filings of Albany International Corp 1. AIC has a 30% market share globally followed by the next two players having a market share of 15% each. One of them is VOITH (the global parent for our India entity).\nIn the Indian context, the entire market is incredibly small. My estimates range between Rs. 350-600 crores2 (based on the method, the figures differ (each has its weakness). But the main takeaway is that the market is tiny).\nThe growth of the market is driven by 3 factors:\nProduction capacity increase/decrease\nCapacity utilization\nPrice increases\nThe relationship between these factors is pretty straightforward. With new production coming online, the demand for felts and fabrics increases (relatively permanently). As capacity utilization increases or decreases, this impacts the wear and tear of the felts. The life of a felt is reported to be between 45-60 days (some have claimed 60+ days as well. Depending on the section, the lifespan ranges between 40 days to 18 months). Price increase is another factor that drives the market size.\nThe growth of the felt industry in aggregate (not a specific player), cannot be greater than that of the paper industry over long periods (then the cost percentages increase beyond what they are right now).\nWith smaller mills, owners are relatively less sensitive to brand/anything. It completely depends on the vendor/person who assembled the machine in which the felt is used. With the larger and organized players, felt quality is a major component of their decision making and they are sensitive to brands.\nIn a cyclical cost-sensitive industry such as paper, felts that can bring about cost savings by way of efficiency for the user are recognized by the larger customers.\nIn India, there are 3 listed companies:\nVoith Paper Fabrics India Ltd.\nShri Dinesh Mills\nWires & Fabriks S A Ltd\nMost people who have used a screener with cash as a % of market cap or any such variant would have comes Voith in the list. Most 90s kids would remember the Dinesh Suitings ads 2 on TV and in theaters. Shri Dinesh Mills owns the brand (at least they used to. It was shut down recently).\nWires & Fabriks S A Ltd has a chemicals business as well. They have a huge debt problem among other issues. Since it is not an investment opportunity for me, I am keeping it aside.\nFrom 2016-2020, Voith has managed to grow its sales from Rs. 75 crores to Rs. 117 crores while Shri Dinesh Mills (SDM) (felt only) has held stead from Rs. 48 crores to Rs. 46 crores in the same period.\nVoith and SDM couldn’t be more different in their approach and growth trajectories. These are two very different stories. More detailed analysis on these two to follow in individual/combined posts.\nThe Edge\nSmall investors have a huge advantage in this space:\nThe companies are either too small or their free float is also too small for any institutions to enter.\nMost of the people who you are transacting with have no idea what the product is or the nature of some of these companies. The companies are often confused with the parent or a fellow subsidiary. (Happens very often in the case of Voith).\nExamples:\nHere’s a Morningstar report 1 that lists JK Paper as a competitor (it should ideally be a customer). Firstcall Research Report 2 lists Sutlej Textiles, Bannari Amman Spinning Mills and Garware Wall ropes as peers. None of them have touched upon listed peers who have been around for ages. (The point isn’t to call out their mistakes, but rather to highlight the fact that even people with far more resources than an individual investor find this sector more trouble (pain to find any info) than it’s worth (limited opportunities)).\n3. Illiquidity! The counters are very illiquid. Tiny changes in quantity are enough to drives prices in either direction. This keeps a lot of people at bay. A double edged sword!\nRisks\nThe biggest risk to the industry is if there is a fundamental change in the way paper is made. It’s been over 2000 years that the macro approach to papermaking has largely been the same. The risk from this is very low.\nNot many people knowing about this industry also leads to difficulty in accessing information and the latest developments in the industry. Companies in the industry have moved from being very open to revealing as little information as possible. This could lead to investors being caught unaware of certain developments.\nThe free cash generated from the business tempts one to look at other avenues that may or may not work out, in effect leading to the felt business subsidizing other business lines.\nChina Factor – the China factor is always there everywhere. But the effect is less pronounced in this industry and certain pockets given the customized nature of the final product.\nIlliquidity can be a problem with large positions while exiting.\nNotes:\n1 – Total Market Size = Albany Revenue*(100/Global Market share)\n2 – The various approaches are:\nMethod 1 : Cost of felt as % of Revenue*Paper Market size\nMethod 2 : Global Felt Market Size*India\'s Share of Global Paper Production Market Share (Production)\nMethod 3 : Sum of 3 public Players turn over * factor\nResources:\nMechanical view of papermaking 1and 2 (these are videos by Voith based on the work they’ve done)\nConvergence Training by Vector Solutions has some really useful training videos on paper manufacturing 1, Tissue making, pulp mill 1, and box plants. One specific video that is useful to understand how felts work. 1 There are videos on the technicality of felts as well.\nHow are felts made\nUnderstanding sleeves\nForming\nDryer\nRoll cover\nSWICOFIL has a good overview while also covering aspects on materials used       .\nAlbany International’s materials – Investor Presentation, Con call, 10K, etc. are really useful. Albany is also an interesting story – how they’ve used this cash to pivot into another segment.\nPaper Machine Clothing by Sabit Adanur 5 is the most comprehensive one-stop resource on this entire industry and process!

The main takeaways are:\nThey are incredibly important products in the process of manufacturing paper. Paper manufacturing cannot take place without them.\nThey are consumables and need to be replaced frequently. (no question of recycling or reusing).\nThe annual cost of felts is insignificant to the entire process and needs to be custom made based on the machines, paper type, etc.\nThese businesses are delinked from the fortunes of their customers.\nTherefore, they combine 2 desirable qualities – subscription (repeat orders frequently) + gold miners (fortunes are delinked in a cyclical industry).\nWhile there are no multi-baggers (10x, etc.), we’ll find our See’s Candies here.\nThe focus of this post is Voith Paper Fabrics India (VPFIL/Voith). VPFIL is part of the Voith Group, a diversified German conglomerate with interests in Hydropower, Paper Making among other things. VPFIL was started in 1968 and came to be part of the Voith Group in 1999 via an acquisition of Porritts & Spencer.\nVPFIL covers all segments of the paper industry - tissue machine, board and packaging, graphics, newsprint, currency, etc. They also cover all the processes of paper manufacturing – forming, pressing, drying, Roll Covers, QualiFlex sleeves for shoe press and Doctor Blades.\nMost of you would have come across Voith in a screener with cash as a % market cap filter or debt-free with a decent ROE filter. Perhaps the best place to start would be the dynamics of the company.\nThe Dynamics – Sales, Capacity, and Financials\nLet’s start with sales.\n Figures in crores FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20\nSales 89.34 95.07 110.70 116.35\nSales Growth   6.41% 16.44% 5.10%\nSales growth impact in FY20 was primarily because of the lockdown in the last quarter.

Exports will continue to be through group companies as “our business is not only supplying a product and then forget about it. We have to give after-sales care, we have to optimize the product, we have to work with machine settings, so the after sales service is very important. We can only take care of Indian market that is our core market, rest of the market what we are trying to do off-late, is to utilize resources available with our Group Company and service those customers through them. We have accelerated this Group activity that is why off late we are able to sell to Europe or any other market through the Group Company, not directly. Directly, we will not be able to sustain”\nWith India being the core market and based on the estimates of market size (350-600 crores) and the FY20 India sales figure, Voith’s market share is anywhere between 17%-29%. As per the management, “(i)n our core products, we have very high market share compared to competition. We are not seeing any dumping on our products in the market..”\nWhile sales and sales growth is one way of looking at things, another way is to look at Voith’s production statistics and their revenue realization (a possible proxy for price).\nThere are 2 major ways in which the company makes money – 1) Manufacturing and selling felts 2) Traded goods i.e. buying them from fellow subsidiaries/group companies and selling them here at a markup. (The third way is selling scrap, etc. which isn’t a significant thing).\nIn the below chart, the focus is solely on manufacturing and selling.\nWith India being the core market and based on the estimates of market size (350-600 crores) and the FY20 India sales figure, Voith’s market share is anywhere between 17%-29%.

(The third way is selling scrap, etc. which isn’t a significant thing).\nIn the below chart, the focus is solely on manufacturing and selling.\nSource: Up until December 2018, Voith used to provide monthly production statistics to the exchange as a disclosure. Subsequent calculations are based on energy figures in the annual report. For realized revenue, the FY from FY16 is the normal April-March cycle. The numbers before are based on Voith’s reporting. FY21 capacity is based on Voith’s claim of 30% expansion in 3 years in FY18.\nThe main takeaways from the above chart are:\nEstimated realized revenue has more or less been range-bound (10% variation).\nVoith has been able to use up most of the additional capacity within 3/4 years of expansion.\nThe implication of this is that we could potentially see another round of capacity expansion in the next few years.\nIt’s important to keep in mind that the impact of external business conditions on felt companies like Voith is always lagged by a few quarters. However, the impact is relatively mild (you will never have a scenario where orders go to zero. Paper mills need to run (irrespective of what capacity they are running at) and they need to frequently change their felts). Sales can decline if the mill isn’t being used.\nOne advantage that Voith has over most of its peers is the group’s integrated operations. Whenever Voith Paper India sells a paper machine, the supply of felts will most likely be tagged to Voith Paper Fabrics. Voith is also able to leverage the R&D developments that happen at the parent level reducing the financial requirements on the business. In return, Voith only has to pay technical royalties.\nFinancials\nA superficial glance at the company’s financials gives you the following impression:\nDecent revenue growth\nPBT margins of 26-27%\nPAT margins of 19-20%\nDebt-free\nRs. 150 crores cash balance\nThings look good.\nBut when you look at the details, you seem to notice that 7-8% of the revenue comes from interest income generated on the Rs. 150 crores cash literally sitting in the bank. This goes straight to the bottom line and inflates both figures – revenue and profit. This doesn’t mean things are bad, but let’s try and understand the business itself and keep the interest income aside.\nThere are 2 major ways in which the company makes money – 1) Manufacturing and selling felts 2) Traded goods i.e. buying them from fellow subsidiaries/group companies and selling them here at a markup. (The third way is selling scrap, etc. which isn’t a significant thing).\nLet’s start with the traded goods. The below table shows the movement in sales, expenses, and margins. All in all, it is a growing business with good margins.\nTRADED GOODS FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20\nSales 6.04 13.71 20.96 19.30\nExpense 5.13 10.87 17.32 15.06\nProfit 0.91 2.85 3.64 4.24\nMargin 15.1% 20.8% 17.4% 22.0%\nSales Growth   127% 53% -8%\nFigures in crores\nThis is a simplistic view. There are other expenses that also get tagged on, but at a basic (gross) level, this is how it works.\nLet’s look at the complete business now.\nFigures in millions FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20\nSales of Manufactured Goods (A1) 792.83 804.39 889.81 963.65 88% 83% 79% 82%\nSales of Traded Goods (A2) 60.44 137.13 209.58 192.98 7% 14% 19% 16%\nTotal sale of services (B) 40.15 9.19 7.65 6.90 4% 1% 1% 1%\nOther operating revenues (C) 7.44 13.82 13.25 12.55 1% 1% 1% 1%\nTotal Revenue From Operations (A1+A2+B+C) 900.85 964.53 1120.29 1176.08 100% 100% 100% 100%\nEXPENSES                \nCost of materials consumed 169.42 199.57 241.04 267.98 19% 21% 22% 23%\nPurchase of stock-in-trade 51.31 108.65 173.17 150.59 6% 11% 15% 13%\nChanges in inventories -6.48 6.63 -6.79 -22.93 -1% 1% -1% -2%\nExcise Duty 85.65 23.41 0 0 10% 2% 0% 0%\nEmployee benefits expense 108.65 123.44 135.44 151.42 12% 13% 12% 13%\nOther expenses 239.83 254.44 284.54 312.64 27% 26% 25% 27%\nDepreciation expense 59.57 58.45 55.63 65.96 7% 6% 5% 6%\nTotal expenses 707.95 774.59 883.03 925.66 79% 80% 79% 79%\nOperating profit 192.89 189.95 237.26 250.42 21% 20% 21% 21%\nExceptional items 0.00 0.00 0 -8.53 0% 0% 0% -1%\nProfit before tax 192.89 189.95 237.26 258.95 21% 20% 21% 22%\nWhile we’ve understood the revenue bit, let’s understand the expenses. The raw material used is relatively inexpensive. The polymers (materials consumed) constitute about 19-23% of revenue. The cost of materials consumed plus the purchase of stock in trade (for traded goods) adds up to about 32-37%. The other major head of expenditure is employee expenses. The other expenses are an amalgamation of contract labour expenses, power, royalties, etc.\nThe raw material is mostly imported and imported in substantial quantity (hence the large inventory figure on the balance sheet). This is done possibly to keep transaction costs low.\nContinuing the same line of thought of looking at the business without cash, what would the return ratios be without the cash balance (assuming 15% of balance with a corresponding impact on reserves)? You get an ROE of about 20% from FY17-20. i.e. the company is able to deploy additional capital at the same rates of return in a stable manner, which isn’t an easy thing to do. (You could take higher numbers, but the point would remain the same).\nLet’s quickly take stock of the main points so far:\nGerman parent company which is a diversified conglomerate.\nVPFIL has a presence across the entire paper industry and the different stages.\nThe main focus is on the Indian market and exports are to group companies or via group companies for after-sales services.\nRealized revenues per kg have largely been flat for a decade and Voith has been able to use up the entire capacity expansion with 3-4 years.\nIt’s sitting on Rs. 150 crores of bank balances. The interest income shores up the revenue and profit figures while the cash balance brings down the return ratios.\nIt has two ways of generating revenue a) manufacture and sell; b) import from a fellow subsidiary and sell (traded goods)\nLooking at the basic functioning of the business, Voith is able to deploy additional capital at the same rate of return in its manufacturing business.\nWe’re also able to deduce that:\nThe company is financially very very conservative.\nThe fundamentals of the business are desirable – decent margins, niche space.\nThe business is stable and has the potential to grow\nKeeping in line the See’s Candies expectation, all the above factors seem to suggest a desirable business. But there are 2 parts left to be addressed.\nAt what price does the desirability manifest?\nWhat are the risks/challenges?\nValuation and Price Trends\nSince 2014, the stock has returned over 400%. While there has been a case of earnings growth, it has also been a case of multiple expansion.\nWhat would be the way to value the company?\nIn the context of Voith, given the capacity situation above, it’s not possible to simply draw take a straight growth rate and apply it throughout the period (well, you can and that is sort of what I’ve done. But it also has to be done keeping in mind capacity and capacity expansion). Let’s look at capacity and the maximum realizable revenue.\nWith capacity expansion being completed in FY21 and an estimated revenue drop of 6% for the full year, their utilization levels should be around 75%. With 7% growth YoY, they would be above 90% in FY24 and would require another round of capacity expansion spread over 2/3 years. This pattern would hold till around 2030 as well. This essentially is a repeat of the last decade in terms of capacity expansion (30% each time). On the traded goods, assume a 7% growth rate as well. Plus interest income on the cash balance of Rs. 150 crores with a yield of 5%, we have a range of Rs. 190-210 crores (discounted). Add the cash balances, this gives us a market cap between Rs. 340-360 crores and a price range of 770-820 (this would imply a PE between 14-15 now). With the average realization hovering around 2000 the past few years (also the decade), considering this in the context of the capacity gives the upper limit on the manufactured revenues.\n(The real estate of 30 acres is recorded at historical cost of Rs. 18 lakhs (1970s). While it may never be monetized beyond the current status of renting out some place to Voith Paper India, this does exist. I had always overlooked the land. User @hcpl2000 brought this issue up).\nTo put these figures in the larger context - with these figures, we’re also looking at a market size range of 580-860 crores in 2031 based on various market share scenarios ranging from 20-30%. (This would imply a paper industry of around Rs. 1.5 lakh crores vs the estimate of Rs. 70,000 crores in 2018/19 1 making this estimate in line with the 6% growth estimate of the paper industry).\nA larger capex scenario could push the numbers upwards while impacting interest income but I haven’t really factored this in as it is a welcome development. Based on production numbers for FY21 and FY22, we’ll know the trajectory. But it does seem like the issue of capacity is being thought about by the management (context below). The above is of course the treadmill scenario where a small incremental capacity expansion of 30% every few years (seems most likely based on past behavior). Other scenarios could be a significantly large capex at one shot and so on.\nRisks/Challenges\nThe Cash\nPerhaps the biggest concern most investors have is of the Rs. 150 crores cash. That’s roughly 30% of the market cap and Rs. 340 per share. Every AGM, investors bring up the issue of the cash balance and increasing dividends and the management remains non-committal. What if something were to happen to it (obviously it’s not going to run away on its own)? What can they do with the cash?\nLet’s think through the options and see the implications:\nOption 1: Distribute the cash back to the investors as a dividend? According to the AGM transcript, the management claims that while the cash appears to be large, the cash needed for expansion is also significant.\n“If we really go for a new line with the latest manufacturing machines from OEMs, the cash lying with us is not enough, even to take up one project. That is why, we are conservative in our approach and I am telling that, yes, we will definitely give dividend for the stakeholders but we request you to remain invested in the normal business, which is remunerative in the normal course of business.”\nBased on the capacity and product graph above, they do seem to be able to utilize their capacity pretty quickly and reach close to the limit. This would make capacity expansion a rather frequent thing (every 3-5 years). The recent 30% capacity expansion has cost them about Rs. 43 crores from FY19 till FY20 (add to this the FY21 figure that will come out). It certainly is an expensive affair. For a company averse to taking on debt and having to rely solely on internal accruals, conserving resources seems to be the only way forward. The company is conservative and has set expectations fairly (although a few more words of clarity would most definitely have helped). This also rules out buybacks. (There was also talk of bonus issue as well, but that’s fairly useless to the investors if the payout remains the same. Apart from some impact in terms of additional liquidity on the market, the impact would be limited).\nOption 2: Buying another company (M&A). This is not an option. I don’t see the point in any acquisition. An acquisition is either for customers or technology. They’ve been able to grow organically and their product is superior to most. Shelling out a premium for an acquisition of something that is happening organically doesn’t seem appealing.\nOption 3: Increase payout at least? This would be an ideal outcome, but it is unlikely to happen because of the explanation in option 1.\nSo cash is just going to sit there until it’s used up for the next capacity expansion. This begs the question, how long are they going to keep expanding capacity? It appears there certainly is a limit. When and how will we reach the limit, I don’t know. But we are on the journey towards reaching that limit and we’re far closer than we were say 5 years ago. Once that is reached, then what? The cash has to go somewhere. (unless the treadmill is scenario is carried on forever). That’s when it will become a See’s Candies variant (paying out most of its profits).\nIncrease in pay outpacing growth\nThere is a significant gap in pay among the ranks. This is going to exacerbate the growth in salaries leading to a scenario where the growth in salaries is higher than the growth in sales. This has already happened to a certain extent.\n  FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20\nSales Growth (Manufactured + Traded + Services) 8.4% 6% 16% 5%\nSalary Growth (median) 13.94% 14.55% 22.01% 16.58%\nSalary Growth (average) 8.94% 12.69% 14.34% 13.24%\nHere’s an extract from the FY20 annual report:\n“As at 31st March, 2020 there were 129 employees on the rolls of the company. For the financial year ended on 31st March, 2020, median remuneration of the employees of the company was Rs. 946,224/-.\nThe ratio of remuneration of the Managing Director, Mr. R. Krishna Kumar to the median remuneration of the employees of the company was 18.05 times…….\nThe percentage increase in the median remuneration of all employees for the year ended 31st March, 2020, over last year’s median remuneration was 16.58%, whereas during this period the company has registered a growth of 28.37%...\nIn case of the CFO, Mr. Kalyan Dasgupta and the Company Secretary, Mr. C.S. Gugliani, the increase in remuneration was 8.28% and 10.85% respectively. Whereas, the average increase in remuneration of employees of the company was 13.24% which is in line with the policy of the company and prevailing market conditions.”\nDesignation Salary (Million)\nMD 17.079\nVP 5.026\nVP 4.339\nDGM 3.297\nDGM 3.114\nChief Manager 2.597\nFun Fact – Rs. 1.7 crores comes upto Rs. 3.88 at the EPS level (pre-tax) and 11.3% of the Employee Benefits Expense for FY20. (The 28.37% growth might be a typo I guess?)\nLow Volumes and IEPF\nThe promoters own 74.04% of the outstanding stock with 3855 individuals owning the remaining 25.96%. In the past 7 months, 1.27 lakh shares have been traded (8.8% of the free float). While the stock is illiquid, the problem is compounded by IEPF becoming one of the largest shareholders (among the lot). This would only increase the pressure on free-float. In March 2021, IEPF jumped from 0.72% to 1.09%. This number would only increase with time to a possible upper limit of 1.7% (that’s the number of shares that haven’t been dematerialized yet). Plus the large shareholders (top 10) have mostly been acquiring or sitting tight on their 5.2% stake.\nNote:\nThese are my personal notes and is not investment advice.

That said, I still think it has enough left on the table for a new entrant.\nCLSE is a old basmati rice player with a modern rice mill and focussed exclusively on basmati rice. They have consistently grown their topline and bottomline over the last 4 years (Sales - 185cr to 510 cr from FY 2010 to FY 2015. PAT - 7 cr to 20 Cr over the same period). Q1 FY 2016 was a bumper quarter with a PAT of 10.8 Cr and margins jumping to 7.8% (as compared to 3.9% for the whole of FY 2014-15 and 2.2% in Q1 of FY 2015) which is the reason why the markets got so excited.\nCLSE has some good differentiated products i.e. basmatic rice for diabtic people, pesticide free basmati rice and I believe they will do well going forward. For the first time, they have started on a branding and marketing exercise in India and that should augur well for them.\nMore importantly, I think 2015-16 will be one of the toughest years for the basmati rice industry as most are carrying overpriced inventory due to the steep fall in paddy prices this season. So this year should truly separate the wheat from the chaff in the basmati rice industry (REI reported huge losses in Q1) !!! and CLSE having done so well in Q1 is a good sign.\nI estimate that the rest of the year will follow the Q1 pattern and we should end up with an eps of 35+ for the current year.\nPositives\nGood, dedicated management\nTechnically sound and one of their promoters is considered an expert in basmati rice.\nconsistent historical growth and focused on the bottomline and margins.\nNegatives\nNot sure if the current year profits is on account of an one-off export order won.\nThey certainly don’t have the pricing power or the brand strengths of KRBL.

Some of the points I noted during the AGM are given below:\n• NCLT approval for the merger is expected to be received by October, 2019. Board will take a call on dividend post the merger.\n• We are working to reduce inventory days in Swiss Glascoat.\n• Order book – Both HLE and Swiss Glascoat have inventory of more than 6 – 7 months.\n• Post-acquisition of Swiss Glascoat by HLE Engineers, we have added quite a few new customers.\n• HLE is a market leader in Agitated Nutsche Filter Dryer (ANFD) with 50% plus market share. Like Glass Line Equipment (GLE), ANFD also have oligopoly market structure with top 3 players controlling 80% of the market. Our largest competitor in ANFD is GMM. We have been in these segment for decades and have built expertise in it over the years.\n• HLE started as a chemical company and later forayed into ANFD. Post restructuring in the group, a portion of chemical business remained in HLE as the ANFD division shared the same premise as that portion of chemical division. We might plan to shut these chemical division going forward. Chemical division contributes Rs.40 – 50 crore to sales of HLE.\n• HLE uses stainless steel while Swiss Glascoat used Carbon Steel. Post-merger, there will be synergies in procurement and increased bargaining power with steel manufacturers.\n• We completed expansion in Swiss Glascoat by almost 40% in February, 2019. The benefit of that will accrue in the current year. Furthermore, we might look for further expansion by year end. Total cost of capex was Rs.15 crore funded through debt and internal accruals.\n• HLE had low margins in FY17 as it was one off year where we had to shut down capacities for undergoing modernization and capacity expansion.\n• Market size for GLE business is Rs.500 crore while for ANFD business is Rs.500 crore. Both the segments are seeing increase in demand due to large capex being undertaken by chemical and pharmaceutical industry (largely API).\n• GMM’s EBITDA margins are higher than Swiss Glascoat on account of some pricing advantage which they have due to their MNC parentage, conversion to gas based furnace and export sales which have much higher margins than domestic markets. There are lot of low hanging fruits in Swiss Glascoat to improve margins. For the expansion, we have used gas based furnace instead of electric furnace installed in existing plant. Furthermore, Swiss Glascoat currently derives negligible revenue from exports. We have started focussing on exports by participating in chemical fairs. We want to focus on export markets as well now. HLE already derives 5 – 10% of revenue from overseas markets.\n• Post takeover by new management, in Swiss Glascoat we have done three major changes:\no Capex for expansion in capacities which got completed in February, 2019\no Substantial debottlenecking done in the plant\no Changed lay out of the plant for better operations\n• Lot of synergies in marketing in HLE and Swiss Glascoat. There are hardly any orders where we are not discussing ANFD and GLE products in the same breadth. HLE does its marketing through its own offices while Swiss Glascoat works through its own channel partners.\n• HLE is also seeing major shift happening from centrifugal filter and dryer market as ANFD is the latest and advanced technology. However, ANFD prices are more than centrifugal ones. Large chemical players already use ANFD while smaller companies in the sector use centrifugal filters and dryers.\n• Replacement cycle for HLE is 10 years plus while for GLE it varies from 3 to 10 years depending on usage. On an average the lifecycle of GLE is 8 – 9 years. However, in more corrosive environment the lifecycle of GLE is less.\n• Growth in Swiss Glascoat will be more than HLE as there is lot of room for improvement in market share in it.\n• Exports are a thrust area for us in Swiss Glascoat. We have participated in trade shows in Germany and received some export orders as well. Export sales will grow sharply as we currently hardly have any sales from it. Europe, South East Asia and US will be our major markets for exports.\n• In terms of quality in GLE, we are at par with our competitors. If companies like Divis, Bayer and other large chemical/pharmaceutical API companies are our customers speaks a lot about our quality. Name any large player in the segment and we would have supplied products to them.\n• Advances from customers range from 10 – 30% depending on client and quantum of order to be supplied – for both HLE and Swiss Glascoat.\n• With current capacity, Swiss Glascoat can do turnover of Rs.180 – 200 crore while HLE’s equipment division can do revenue of Rs.250 – 300 crore.\n• HLE holds 80% stake in HL Equipment which has a plant in Silvassa. It also manufactures ANFD.\n• ANFDs are highly customized and complex products. Requirement of each and every customer is different. We have also launched off the shelf model in FY19 targeting smaller chemical companies where there is no customization and price is lower. The machine received good success.\n• Operating leverage can come in both the companies – HLE and Swiss Glasscoat with increase in revenue.\n• Inventory is on higher side in Swiss Glascoat compared to GMM? Taking measures to improve inventory days. Increased vendor base to two from earlier one. We require specialized carbon steel. Inventory day rationalisation will take time but will eventually happen.\n• We supply reactors as well as tanks. We are also present in high KL reactors and provide the entire range to customers.\n• Target growth of 15 – 20% in revenue over the next 2 – 3 years in both the companies combined.','Aug 29, 2019 1:51 pm'),(1872,306,592,'With regards to the parent, the shift from centrifuge to ANFD is certainly true …multiple centrifuges have to employed to clear out single GLR reaction batch, whereas with the use of ANFD the entire batch can be processed in one go in ANFD of a respectable size.Even smaller chemical companies are shifting to ANFD, centrifuges also require regular maintenance with the bearings giving out every now and then, which is not the case with a hydraulic or a gear ANFD.\nSo in addition to GLR there should be sustained demand from ANFD side as well','Nov 12, 2019 10:17 pm'),(1873,306,6,'Thanks for the info. whats the opp size of ANFD & GLE ? are u in some way associated with the chemical sector ?Any idea about the promoter quality of new promoters of Swiss glasscoat ie the promoters of HLE mr Himanshu patel n mr aalap patel? views invited from other VPers too?','Nov 12, 2019 10:21 pm'),(1874,306,592,'I run an agrochemical plant, have recently replaced some of our centrifuges with used ANF, thus the knowledge, i am not sure of HLE personally but they have a good name in the market at least for the ANFD.\nwith regards the opportunity, i won’t be able to put an number on it, but GLR, ANF, dryer is the basic infrastructure required for any chemical or pharma plant, so with all this new capacity going up with the shift from industry from china to india should create some sustained demand.','Nov 12, 2019 10:30 pm'),(1875,306,6,'ENGINEERING REVIEW – 29 Sep 15 16\n50% battle won once we started using NORD Gear box – HLE Engineers 16\nHLE, one of the largest manufacturers of filtration and drying equipment across the globe with a CAGR of 25%, established in the year 1981.

Please share your findings','Sep 14, 2018 8:12 pm'),(1937,309,529,'Time technoplast (it’s a well run company operationally, except for lagging profits):\nPlease do comment/ highlight, if you as a reader find the analysis lacking/ wrong.\nEstd. in 1989 and employing c.3,600; it is a polymer product marketer/ manufacturer making multiple products like bin, drum, containers can etc. I found this report on google and the analyst summarises the company’s operations nicely.\nhttp://www.hdfcsec.com/Share-Market-Research/Research-Details/StockReports/3018654 82\nBelow is my observation around the company:\nAlthough, every analyst report talks about industrial packaging, lifestyle and other segments; the actual ones disclosed in annual report are polymer (earlier in 2011 yielding 15 odd percent EBIT, now three year average is 10.2%) and the other one being composite, consistently yielding c.9.7%. That said, Time doesn’t define the two segments anywhere in terms of product lines, business or any parameter!!\nTheir primary business is industrial packaging from which it derives three quarters of its revenues. In terms of geography, it derives c.two third of this industrial business domestically and remaining third is from overseas. In the segment, its customer profile is primarily chemical companies, contributing more than half of the segment’s revenue and the other big chunk is fmcg. Both these business are expected to do good in terms of sales volumes (remember the high PEs of the two industries). In terms of geography, Time has now moved out from Korea, China and Poland; and now focusing only on high growth geographies, which is very good decision i think, especially for its volume growth story.0\nThe other key segment is infra (c15% of revenues), comprising of pipes, prefabs etc. If we continue to believe in the Indian infra story, I do not foresee any volume growth concerns here and thus increasing profitability. The pipes business grew by 15% in FY16. Battery business they are willing to sell.\nThe two other small businesses (5% each) are lifestyle (mats etc) and automotive components. The former might see some increasing competition (essentially commodity, limited specs) but its auto business might continue to flourish where spec requirement is high.\nThe other business is its composite cylinder; first I noticed its mention around some report of 2011 (yes 2011). The business over the years languished with company shifting its bases; now entire 700k/annum capacity in India. These cylinders are in different sizes, slightly (c.20%) more expensive than the regular ones; and given the kind of product it is, it requires a lot of approvals in each country. This business is finally now gaining traction with some volume visibility and approvals from c.25 countries. Although adoption by the markets is yet to be tested (trial quantities so far); but as a consumer if given an offer, I would like to have an explosion proof and more aesthetic cylinder; even at a few extra rs and just the Indian replacement demand is more than 20 mm a year. This business represents a huge opportunity, but only in a few years time, after the early adoption stage. The other competitor to them domestically is Supreme with 400k capacity.\nManagement: In terms of management, what I really like is that all of the executive directors have professional background, with some working in prominent companies of their time. All of them prior to forming Techno, were working in Prestige HM Polycontainers; and if you note from company’s website, they are performing the same functions now as back then in HM-polycontainers; one from finance, marketing and production!!! The other good thing I like is lack of equity dilution (in terms of new issues/ esops etc) over the years.\nIn terms of its shareholding: promoters hold c.58.5%; while DIs hold 8.7% and FIIs hold 19.5%. The amount of institutions shares has been around 30% for few years now.\nOperational/ financial metrics:\n• Revenue CAGR over last three years is 11.2% (noting FY16 flattish due to commodity prices (volume growth was 10%) and 14.2% over five years. With the company present in high growth geography, volume and thus revenue growth should remain elevated over the medium term, with a possibly good kicker coming from cylinders in two-three years time.\n• EBITDA margins have remained relatively constant over three years (c.14%) but this should improve (reasons below) with increasing operational leverage with volume ramp-up.\n• The Company has been good at cash flow generation and that is after deducting cash interest from operating cash flow. The company has consistently reduced its free cash flow deficit (CFO less cash interest, capex and dividends) over last five years; turning positive in FY15 and FY16 is expected to be no different.\n• Working capital management has been very good with cash conversion cycle hovering around 95 days over past few years (increased in FY16 to 106, but lets wait for annual report). Lately, from my work experience I understand that business and competition intensity is increasing in India and a cost of this in domestic market has been increasing working capital cycle; which thankfully this company has avoided so far.\n• In terms of asset turnover as well; Time has shown improvement increasing from 0.9 in FY13 to 1.04 in FY16.\n• The only area it has lagged in is profitability, which along with increasing equity base has resulted in low ROE of c.10.5% over last few years.\n• Liquidity of the Company looks fine and debt appears to be very manageable at 772 crs with current cash flow and growth outlook (AA- rating by crisil).\nKey driver in growth going forward would be:\n• Expected good volume growth of overseas units, which will mean better capacity utilization (FY16: 65%, of overseas units) and lower fixed costs/unit.\n• Above is true for Indian business as well but the volume growth is lacking its overseas operations; although was at good 10% yoy in FY16 and capacity utilization at 85%\n• FY16, they discontinued certain business, because of which results were not comparable; accounting for which FY16 revenue, EBITDA and PAT would have grown 5.1%, 6.9% and 8.7% yoy.\nIncreasing focus on growth from internal accruals, which should improve balance sheet, and limit interest outgo.\nPossible improvement in incremental margins in the industry itself, with demand getting picked up.\nQuote from the concall on future growth ”Anil Jain- So I would close on the note that we have set out targets for ourselves FY-2021 the turnover of this company and the profits et cetera will be double of what we have done in FY’15-FY’16 and our ROCE should be in excess of 20%.” This appears to me a manageable target and during the call he also mentioned of keeping the debt max at current levels and fund the future growth from internal cash. This also looks believable with good cash flow generation and tight working capital control so far; which if happens would be a double bonanza for equity investors with growth and same debt levels; a significant jump to EPS.\nThe Company is currently trading at a trailing PE of 12 in mid 60s; lower than its peers on relative valuation multiple, with good operational record, making me think its slightly undervalued and might get rerated in the medium term with hopefully better results. Also, the stock has seen remarkable upward momentum in short term, and may be its prudent to wait for some time to settle down before adding positions(but just my view).\nDisclosure: I am invested in the stock at an average price point of INR50.6/ share (c.5% of my portfolio), invested over last two months.','Aug 4, 2016 10:35 pm'),(1938,309,529,'the company has reported 1q results, as per which on a continued basis volume growth was 13% and pat growth was 15%. with increasing focus on improving roce and managing debt at current levels (further capex to come from internal cash generation), the story still remains as intact from two-three year perspective!\nhttp://corporates.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/4A7F72DF_D090_468E_ACB2_AB987714C2B6_184501.pdf 6','Aug 13, 2016 10:32 pm'),(1939,309,388,'What I find to be a little disconcerting in this company is the lack of willingness to get rid of debt completely.

Making it a commodity with little differentiation\nCustomers: 80% of Nile Ltd.\'s lead division’s revenues come from a single customer (Amara Raja).

I believe there will be a lot of volatility in the results of the company for the years to come. The current P/E ratio for such a company offers a margin of safety, with regards to the safety of principle but for achieving a satisfactory return commensurate with the effort put in the analysis an investor will have to wait for the P/E ratio to expand (which in itself is speculation I believe) in the absence of any moat present in the business.\nDisclosure: Not Invested\nP.S.: The views expressed are in light of the present facts and are subject to change in the light of newer ones.','Sep 4, 2017 2:34 pm'),(1966,310,167,'I was looking to compare Nile Ltd. with Gravita over the weekend as well and came up with similar conclusions.

(possibly NCL, Pune helped) commencing production in August, 1985 by producing Erythromycin and Erythromycin salts and formulations. The company was subsequently taken over in June 1991 by the Yuhan Group (one of the biggest South Korean pharma cos) and Pharmaceutical Business Group (India) Ltd. (PBG); a unique consortium of five competing drug companies - Themis Medicare Ltd (TML), Kopran Ltd., Anant & Co., Cadila Health Care Ltd. (Zydus) and Lyka Labs Ltd. It is being actively managed by Themis Medicare Ltd. (JV Company of Gedeon Richter Ltd, Hungary) since 2007.

CAGR is quite uneven, company had early turnaround from BIFR in FY2016 technically but only acknowledged in FY2018 AR. Now it appears that it is able to deploy a strong growth strategy.

Under the scheme of re-habilitation a lot of operating and functional changes were brought in the company. The Face Value of each share of the Company was reduced from Rs.10 to Rs. 5 and the reduction in the value of equity shares was utilized to write-off a part of accumulated losses of the Company . Themis Medicare Ltd. was inducted as co-promoter of the Company and issued 2928702 shares of FV rs 5 at 10rs each. The induction of Themis as a co-promoter brought in the much needed sting and zeal in the operations of the company. The new promoters also brought in the sole long term customer in Lupin . Lupin’s deal with GTBL changed the fortunes of the company. The contours of this deal were very lucrative for GTBL. GTBL entered into a contract with lupin to supply Rifa (with the technology know-how brought in with another co-promoter – Yuhan Corporation). Lupin gave GTBL interest-free loan for capex that was required to finish the contract. This loan from Lupin was a returnable non-interest bearing loan and was repayable against 50% of the “Conversion Charges” for each invoice raised. So, this deal was beneficial to GTBL in more than one ways. Needless, to say this contract brought in very good topline and bottomline for the company.\nTo the credit of GTBL, with each passing quarter the company has been improving its operating efficiency and it now has one of the best operating parameters in the industry. With announcement of the supply agreement with Lupin that started from 1st April 2015 – Mar 2018 the company got solid visibility to its earnings. This had a very positive impact on the fiscal position of the company. Since the company came out of BIFR, the company will expand to newer products. Additionally, the company is also exploring the possibility of “offshoring” some of the manufacturing of its another promoter, Yuhan Corporation. Given the already established operational efficiency of the company any increase in revenue would significantly add to the bottomline too and the company is expected to clock significant revenue and profit growth in the years to come.\nFrom AR FY2018\n\nwhich may explain more freedom in operating decisions and general uptick in revenues since then.\nProducts as per cos website:\nhttp://www.gtbl.in/products/ 15\nConcerns:\nThemis seem to dominate the overall management and that could be a concern given that they themselves have a chequered track-record.\nInvestor friendliness may also be an issue due to promoter domination but that may improve(?) as company scales operations.

Ltd – 2% (JK Arora has 89.56% stake)\n• Institutional holding - Nil\nIndustry Overview:\n• Per capita consumption of alcohol in India is one of the lowest in the world – due to social stigma, high government interference and high taxes\n• Beer industry is mainly concentrated in Southern states of India with market share of these states at 50%, mostly due to hot climate throughout the year. Some seasonality in sales of beer.\n• Industry is strongly skewed towards IMFL. Among beers, strong beers are preferred -\nAlcohol is taxed by total volume, and not by volume of alcohol. Thus in comparison, on basis of alcohol volume, beer is taxed higher than IMFL.\nThus IMFL has greater share (67%) in alcohols in India vs beers (26%). This is skewed compared to other countries. Beer market valued at Rs. 448 billion in 2016. Expected to grow at 8.6% for next 5 years. IMFL market valued at 2040 billion and expected to grow at 8.2% in next five years.\nStrong beers are seen as more value for money by consumers. This is in contrast to other countries where light/premium beers are preferred.\n• Ban on direct advertisements and promotion imply that for a brand to become successful it has to invest in surrogate advertising such as glasses, mineral water, music items etc.\nKey Developments:\n• Woodpecker beer (in Mar 2017) and other four IMFL brands (in Nov 2016) allowed supply to CSD in March 2017.

Increase from 16 to 36 outlets.\n• Diversify geographically into growth markets such as Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and increase sales in legacy markets such as Delhi and MP-Chhatisgrah\n• Decrease seasonality in revenue from beer by increasing sales of IMFL and RTD drinks.\nFinancial statements:\nBalance sheet\nProfit & Loss Statement\nInvestment rationale:\nOverall consumption theme of beer in India remains good. Per capita consumption of beer in India is low. While this is not expected to increase dramatically in the short term, the growth of premium brands in cities is a good growth opportunity.\nOnly listed player having both beer and IMFL products. These may complement each other and reduce seasonality going forward.\nDiversifying into key markets in South India (TN, AP, Kerala) where beer is widely consumed. Karnataka has 10% market share of beer in India.\nVentured into craft beer with White Owl. I see this as a potential market with opportunity to give competition to Bira. I have personally had these beers in Goa and found them to be very good, will post pics in next post.\nAbility to sell to CSD is a positive. Company expects 15-20% of topline from this. I believe that is already reflecting with improved sales in last three quarters. Out of 36 CSD outlets, Som is catering to 16. Margins projected to be better.\nFew home grown brands that have successfully scaled up to become national players in beer. This is due to regulatory setup. Ability to manufacture and cross-sell in different states is a major advantage.\nGood financials - maintained EBITDA margins of 15% (except drop to 9% immediately after highway ban) and maintained a healthy balance sheet with gross debt to equity at end of Dec 2017 at 0.48. Dividend paying company with dividend payout ratio > 25%. RoCE at 14-16% for last 3 years.\nRisk factors:\nIndustry wide risks\n• Highly taxed consumption item makes in unaffordable for a number of consumers.\n• High regulatory interference including bans that may disrupt operations suddenly. For example, in 2017 there was scare that alcohol would be prohibited in MP, but company came out with statement what Finance Minister of MP has clarified that Excise policy of 2017-18 does not have any fix plan for prohibition.\n• Unfavourable judgements such as the ban on alcohol near highways. Also the Constitution of India has Directive Principle (article 47) that states “…the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health\".\n• State wise differences in regulations make it difficult to market and sell across states.\n• Difficulty in building a brand that catches the attention of the youth. Significant advertising and marketing costs might mar margins in the future.\nLow promoter holding. Some sources say that some public shareholding is with distributors and other related parties, but this needs to be confirmed.\nPromoter was super bullish in 2013 when they said they will double sales. Has only now started improving topline. I believe projections given by promoter have to be taken with a pinch of salt. Delay could have also been to legal matters as noted in point 7.\nWorking capital cycle has fluctuated in the past couple of years and was as high as 125 days in 2016.

As I understand after settling issue, Som further appealed the decision as unjust – and most recent order is here - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/59356510/ 25\nOther inconsistencies:\nAnnual report 2017 says that interest due but not paid was to tune of 1.21 crores.

The margin on drugs has improved by 170 basis points. Maybe because of higher realization for Ibuprofen.\n4- Profit: Not accounting for the deferred tax the PAT would had been 109 cr vs 90 cr in previous quarter and 85 cr a year ago in the same quarter. So without deferred tax company still reported 20% PAT growth QoQ and 30% YoY.\n5- EPS for the quarter stood at 22.30 which is 50% up both QoQ and YoY.\n6- Assets => There is 30% increase YoY. Both Chemical and Drug assets have seen increase.\n7- Capacity: Metformin capacity increased from 4000 MT per annum to 11200 MT per annum. Ibuprofen: 12000 MT per annum.\nMy interpretations\n1- Because of better product mix and/or better cost realization the margins are getting better.

Capacity constraint or demand contraction should not be the reason given what we have heard in the earnings call of other API players.\nb)Another possibility could be the negative perception about the usage of Ibuprofen for a brief period, which was later found incorrect.\n3- Given that margins were better for both Chemical and Drug, the only thing missing was topline growth. If company could produce more then possibly it would have disproportionate profits.\n4- The company has guided for 20-25% topline growth YoY. Given that topline in Q1 was 6% down YoY, IOL has to grow at 30% plus topline to meet the guidance. If the company would indeed be able to do it, then the profit would be far better than 30% (again because of better margins).\n5- Metformin increased capacity seem to have come at right time because there seem to be shortage of Metformin in market: https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/shortage-metformin-modified-release-500-mg-multiple-brands 18. Earlier management was able to bring in additional capacity for Ibuprofen just before the shortage. Putting both points on the table, it does seem that management is able to tap on these market opportunities which shows agility & competence.\n6- Valuation: TTM EPS after Q1 results is 70.81 which translates to PE of 11. Median PE for 1 year is 3.3, 3 years 12.5 and 5 years is 15.8.\nThe company does not have debt, and has significant cash on the books (from the Q4 BS).

Interestingly the employee cost is flat YoY. I expected this to go up because of Covid related expenses.\n3- PBT\na) 8.36 cr which is 5.3%, vs 3.6% vs 3.8% (QoQ and YoY). < The margin on Chemical product was better in this quarter>\nb) 138 cr or 44% vs 43% vs 42.3%. The margin on drugs has improved by 170 basis points. Maybe because of higher realization for Ibuprofen.\n4- Profit: Not accounting for the deferred tax the PAT would had been 109 cr vs 90 cr in previous quarter and 85 cr a year ago in the same quarter. So without deferred tax company still reported 20% PAT growth QoQ and 30% YoY.\n5- EPS for the quarter stood at 22.30 which is 50% up both QoQ and YoY.\n6- Assets => There is 30% increase YoY. Both Chemical and Drug assets have seen increase.\n7- Capacity: Metformin capacity increased from 4000 MT per annum to 11200 MT per annum. Ibuprofen: 12000 MT per annum.\nMy interpretations\n1- Because of better product mix and/or better cost realization the margins are getting better. On top of that the company being debt free is definitely helping the profitability.\n2- The revenue came almost flat which could be because of (this is just my guess).\na)The company could not produce more products because of Covid (logistical challenges). Capacity constraint or demand contraction should not be the reason given what we have heard in the earnings call of other API players.\nb)Another possibility could be the negative perception about the usage of Ibuprofen for a brief period, which was later found incorrect.\n3- Given that margins were better for both Chemical and Drug, the only thing missing was topline growth. If company could produce more then possibly it would have disproportionate profits.\n4- The company has guided for 20-25% topline growth YoY. Given that topline in Q1 was 6% down YoY, IOL has to grow at 30% plus topline to meet the guidance. If the company would indeed be able to do it, then the profit would be far better than 30% (again because of better margins).\n5- Metformin increased capacity seem to have come at right time because there seem to be shortage of Metformin in market: https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/shortage-metformin-modified-release-500-mg-multiple-brands 18. Earlier management was able to bring in additional capacity for Ibuprofen just before the shortage. Putting both points on the table, it does seem that management is able to tap on these market opportunities which shows agility & competence.\n6- Valuation: TTM EPS after Q1 results is 70.81 which translates to PE of 11. Median PE for 1 year is 3.3, 3 years 12.5 and 5 years is 15.8.\nThe company does not have debt, and has significant cash on the books (from the Q4 BS).

The co. deals with 95% of FMCG cos. in India covering Multinational,National,Regional and even Local cos. Fragrances is mainstay business and Flavours is roughly 1/8 of the total business currently. The business is very sticky in nature,the co. is a sole supplier to Cinthol since 1952 for example. The co. has a range of 9000 odd fragrances and 40000 odd prototypes. Fragrances involve a complex manufacturing process typically requiring 40-80 ingredients and a multi-step process with laser like precision to churn out one fragrance. The co. sources 1500 ingredients in total. Diverse use of ingredients and proprietary processes complemented by unique infrastructure give the co. an edge over competition and makes products impossible to replicate. The co. is very R&D focused and always looking to add new variety of fragrances to its range and for the same,it employs 12 perfumers who design and synthesise fragrances. Perfumers are master-crafters and a real asset to the co.,there are only 1000 odd perfumers in the world. The co. has also developed molecules which help in manufacturing multiple fragrance compounds and is in the process of filing patents for the same. The co. has 4000 odd customers out of which roughly 2000 are shops and distributors with 20000 touch-points. The co. also started retailing of fragrances in small packets which generate 7% of sales currently. 70% of revenues is from made-to-order for a customer and rest is from made-to-stock wherein someone could buy 2-3 fragrances,mix it up and develop a new fragrance an sell in the market. The growth in the past few years has been 16-17% out of which 10% approx. is coming from growth in existing FMCG products for which the co. is supplier,2%-3% from new FMCG products added and rest from price realisation going up. The co. expects to grow similarly going forward or slightly better going forward. The co. spent 200 cr in CAPEX to expand facilities and modernisation in last few years and would require only maintenance CAPEX going forward for a long time. Current capacity utilisation is 40% and current capacity can help treble sales from current level. Requirement of WC won’t be proportional to increase in sales going forward as certain level of raw-material is treated as fixed in nature and it can support even higher sales maintaining the current level. Fixed Asset turns will improve as capacity is utilised going forward. Reduction in WC and improving Fixed Asset turns would give a fillip to ROCE.

This is the single biggest entry barrier in the industry as such trust gets built only by multi-years of close association as well as a great credible standing of the management of F&F company in the industry.\nSecondly, if the product or the variant launched is a success, its a rare chance that fragrance ingredients and its precise ratio will ever be changed and so the client remains with the F&F company for the entire lifecycle of the product. This is the second biggest entry barrier.\nDearth of new product launches will be a saturation phase for the F&F industry whereas more new product/variant launches will mean growth phase for the Indian F&F industry.\nCiting below a broad segmentation of Indian F&F and allied industry :\nAs far as SH Kelkar is concerned, it is the largest and the best Indian-origin player in Indian F&F space. It’s current valuations are a real dampener for me but considering the low floating stock, it is unlikely to trade at cheap valuations in the near future…If one attempts detailed study of the segment, some interesting facts get unleashed…\n– SHK was No. 2 player in Indian F&F space after IFF in 2005…it has slipped to No.4 player now ; first three being Givaudan, IFF and Firmenich in that order…all these three top players are MNCs.\nEach of the top player in the industry except Givaudan has lost market share in India over a 10 year period from 2005 to 2015.

Even Goldfield is mentioned but why Oriental is not mentioned that is a question mark for me !!!}\nIt’s from seventh position onwards that companies have suffered the most – for ex., Khattri’s market share has dwindled from 3.17 % in 2005 to 0.01 % in 2015, Goldfield’s market share has dwindled from 2.82 % in 2005 to 1.12 % in 2015, Gupta & Co.\'s market share has dwindled from 2.03 % in 2005 to 0.72 % in 2015 and likewise…\n– MNCs have dominated the Indian F&F space with them still controlling more than 60 % marketshare as at 2015.\n– As far as Indian-origin companies are concerned, SH Kelkar & Oriental Aromatics are two dominant players that have sustained MNC onslaught as well as emergence of many small Indian players over last 10 years.\n– Both these companies have made significant investments in building their capacities and ramping up their R&D infrastructure over last few years and both are at present operating at 45-50 % capacity utilisation.\nMentioned below are the CAGRs of both the Indian-origin companies’ domestic business :\nTo conclude, to me the industry looks interesting and exposure at right valuations could very well reward us. But ‘Right Valuations’ seems to be the key as Inventory days (SH Kelkar 6 Years’ Average = 143 days ; Oriental Aromatics 6 Years’ Average = 135 days) and Debtor Days (SH Kelkar 6 Years’ Average = 89 days ; Oriental Aromatics 6 Years’ Average = 64 days) are not low and therefore any sudden and significant increase in cost of RM is not immediately passable but is surely passable with a lag.\nRgds.\nDiscl.-\nNo Investment in SH Kelkar.\nInvested in Oriental Aromatics.','Aug 27, 2016 12:53 pm'),(2160,314,668,'Hello sir,\nCompany looking expensive\nDisc: tracking','Aug 29, 2016 7:47 pm'),(2161,314,669,'BUYBACK APPROVED AT 180/-.\nbseindia.com 20\n20\n6398E784_538D_45F6_8571_C580731C8424_173355.pdf 20\n1217.94 KB','Jun 15, 2019 11:51 am'),(2162,314,315,'https://www.investing-notes.com/s-h-kelkar-nse-shk/ 258\nAn analyst’s note on SH Kelkar (Keva).','Sep 27, 2019 6:14 pm'),(2163,314,484,'any idea what is happening on this stock.

Out of this total value, 55.0% was attributable to the Indian fragrance market, and 45.0% to the Indian flavour market.\nDisposable incomes are rising in the world’s emerging markets together with consumer spending, especially in the emerging middle class that is increasingly able to afford packaged food and beverages and personal care items. Emerging markets are expected to be the primary growth driver of the global fragrance and flavour industry. As the economy grows, people consume more products. A number of these products are concentrated across half a dozen fastest-growing categories. By providing the largest quantum of fragrances in India, Keva has emerged as an indirect driver and faithful proxy of the Indian economy.\nFragrances and flavours are considered to be one of the important factors for consumers in deciding whether to repurchase a product and these factors often influence their decisions, thereby making them one of the key components of FMCG and integral part of product attributes.\nBarriers to Entry The global fragrance and flavour industry is characterized worldwide by high barriers to market entry.

While it is able to raise prices, there is typically a lag which hits profitability in the medium term. “We have large stock-in-trade which results in huge working capital requirements,” says Vaze.

These comprise personal care, hair care, skin care and cosmetics, fabric care, household products and fine fragrances\nYear 2017\nIn the past, we were content being a large Indian company. We soon realised that our market was relatively small by global standards; the time then has come to evolve from the ‘small big’ Indian Company to the ‘big small’ global company.\nKeva will enter select countries instead of spreading thin across a large number. In view of this, our global presence will be generally built bottom-up through a deeper understanding of grass-root customer needs as opposed to sitting in India and attempting to guess what might work in remote markets.\nFor one, we do not expect to enter a large number of countries at one shot; we will enter only as many countries that fit into our strategic attractiveness criteria. Besides, we will enter only those geographies where we see demographics unfold the way they did in India, leveraging our familiarity into how consumer response and appetites will evolve in the future.\nDid three small acquisitions but all in India – Different from stated objective\nOpened a fragrance Studio in Amsterdam\nYear 2018\nThe Flavours business was also hit by strong headwinds due to geopolitical turbulences and a sharp hike in citrus oils and other raw materials leading to 18% decline in the international market\nInterestingly, this performance came despite the unprecedented raw material disruptions in the later half of the year, which we weathered successfully through our focussed inventory management.\nThere were some unprecedented supply-side disruptions that impacted the industry during the year\nExternal factors beyond our control caused these disruptions, which included some problems with supply of ingredients due to a major fire in BASF’s German chemical plant, forcing them to declare a force majeure.\nThen there was the environmental clean-up drive in China that led to the closure of several chemical plants in the country.\nThe hurricane Irma, which hit Florida in September 2017, adversely affected the availability of citrus oils and other raw materials, which hit the supply chain quite badly.\nThe acquisition of Creative Flavours & Fragrances SpA (CFF), an Italian company headquartered in Milan, endorsed this strategy. With the acquisition, which took place in January 2018, we have acquired 51% ownership stake in CFF, which is one of the top five players in the Italian market today and is engaged in the production and sale of fragrances.\nAs per the agreement, the company is to acquire 51% stake upfront for approx. Euro 12 million. Remaining stake shall be acquired within three years, consideration for which shall be paid based on CFF’s performance.\nWe believe this acquisition, along with our Fine Fragrance Studio in Amsterdam, will strengthen our strategy to expand our presence and product offerings in our focussed growth areas.\nThe Studio has excellent synergies with the newly acquired CFF, as both Amsterdam and Milan, being fashion capitals of the world, will provide us with access to the premium ingredients.\nKeva Fragrances Pvt Ltd has acquired 100% share capital of VN Creative Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. (‘VNCC’), which is in the business of aroma ingredients. The acquisition provides us full control of land and manufacturing facility in Mahad, Maharashtra, giving us the lever to optimise our Opex in the overseas fragrance division. We expect to showcase higher operational efficiency in the Fragrance division from FY 2018-19 onwards as a result of this initiative\nOne major step that we expect to significantly add to our cost efficiencies is our decision to operationally reorganise PFW Aroma Ingredients B.V. (‘PFW’), which is expected to be completed by mid-2018. Restructuring of the PFW operations is expected to allow greater flexibility in backend manufacturing, leading to better profitability going forward.

Another disclaimer (also present in the video) is that this YouTuber is also a shareholder of Meghmani. In general I have found his videos to be quite honest and this is why I trust his judgement. Investors that do not trust him should definitely not be looking to hold or buy this company. The TL;DR of the videos is that when MFL was setup (in 2007-08), the contract between IFC, MOL and promoters promised 50L share warrants to the promoters at the prevailing rate of 30 rupees. In Ravinder’s opinion, this is not unethical, and I agree with him.\nRegarding the fires, I find it unfortunate that we would try to make fun of the a chemical company’s factories catching.

We should definitely question management about measures being taken to prevent future accidents.\nAlthough the management quality is suspect in the mind of the investors, as per my own limited deep dive, most concerns are unwarranted.

I’ve tried to be accurate with the info here but more than happy to be corrected as most info has been taken from news reports, google searches and free broker notes.\nI wonder what fellow investors think of KPIT Tech (earlier known as KPIT Cummins). I do own a bit and may be looking to buy more hence look forward to learning what fellow investors think. A brief background of the company follows:\nKPIT is an IT services company that provides varied services and products to multiple industries, primarily in USA and Europe. The market capitalisation of the company is about Rs. 3000 crore with FY14 revenue of ~ Rs 2700 crore, Ebitda of Rs 422 crore and PAT of nearly Rs 240 crore (EPS of Rs 13.42). KPIT generates an ROE of 20%, ROCE of 29% and Ebitda margin of 15.7%. The company has grown its revenue and PAT at a 38% Cagr over the last three years. Also, the management has set itself a revenue target of US$1bn for FY17 (Rs6000 crore, at a 20% Ebitda) which translates into a revenue Cagr of over 30% going forward if the target is to be met.\nDetailed financials are available at http://www.moneycontrol.com/financials/kpittech/consolidated-profit-loss/KPI02 11\nI am not an IT sector specialist, but it appears to me to not be a run-of-the-mill IT company given that the top management has keen interest in developing the atecha side of the business versus just the business IT side. As per a statement from the CEO in Sept 2013, technology (custom algorithms, own software, development of independent products etc) forms about 33% of the company revenue with the rest being business IT (ERP implementation, portals, website, business applications etc). This mix they want to make 50-50. Also the company doesnat compete in the crowded banking/ insurance space like many other IT cos but concentrates on automotives, manufacturing and energy/ utilities space. Conceptually I like the automotive vertical as intuitively I feel cars and other automotive equipment will have more and more software/ electronics going forward. KPIT is already the largest 3rd party auto electronics vendor in India and so should be a prime beneficiary of this trend.\nA key irritant for the stock IMHO has been KPITas relentless acquisitions over the last few years that may have perhaps led to dilution, negative free cash flows and integration issues. But I think that KPIT management is recently through with a restructuring exercise and so perhaps one might see execution capabilities and efficiencies increase. Also, I am unsure if acquisitions can continue indefinitely.\nAs per a recent MO report on KPITa\nhttp://www.motilaloswal.com/Financial-Services/Research/Detailed-Report/Results-Update-Review/10275/532400 26\naIts FY15 and FY16 EPS stands at Rs 13.5 and Rs 17.1 respectively. However, I notice that the analyst has factored Ebitda margins of 14.8% and 15.9% for the years, which are virtually at par with 4QFY14 levels. I of course donat claim to understand companies as well as sector specialists, esp IT, but wonder if he/ she has been too conservative in factoring in the managementas restructuring exercise or the profitability of the companies that KPIT has bought since 2003/ 2004. Is there then room for investoras assessment of the companyas fortunes to be jerked upward? KPIT has managed to clock Ebitda margins of 18-20% in the past and this is in-line with their target for FY17 so it isnat completely unreasonable to assume that margins will move closer to 20% in the next two years.\nBut even assuming that the current estimates are correct, KPIT only trades at 8-9x FY16 earnings. It appears to me all the negatives are factored but valuation leaves no room for any positive surprises. Maybe I am wrong, please do share your views on the company!\nPS: Owning KPIT also offers an option on the success of Revolo which seems to me is an exciting possibility: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolo 36\nThanks!','Aug 19, 2014 2:22 pm'),(2241,316,220,'Nice write up anirudha.\nI was invested in KPIT sometime back based only on technicals and tried to read up on\nthe company and was impressed with the company’s business.\nIt definitely doesnt seem a run of the mill software company.','Aug 19, 2014 3:16 pm'),(2242,316,594,'Agree with Hitesh.

Looks higher than most of the industry.','Aug 19, 2014 4:50 pm'),(2243,316,690,'Valid point wrt acquisitions I think. I mention the acquisitions as one of the impediments to investor interest to the stock in my main writeup.\nBut, I am not too worried about the acquisitions as all of them appear to be well focused in the areas that KPIT wants to grow in. My best guess is that the management considered buying expertise/ clients advantageous vs. trying to grow the same organically.\nE.g. CG Smith was acquired in 2006 for US$6m and that marked KPIT’s true large scale foray into automotive sector. Today Auto contributes over a fourth of KPIT revenues. Similarly, Sparta was acquired in 2009 for their strong presence in USA in the SAP space. SAP is also about 23% of revenues today, USA. as a whole contributes over 70%. Also, CPG solutions bought in 2010 brings in customer base for Oracle in the USA if Im not mistaken. The latest one is i-Cubed…which is a Product Life cycle management company appears to be an instance of KPIT trying to increase the intensity of its client mining esp in the manufacturing and auto space.\nSo yes, whilst it would have been best if KPIT had acquired the required expertise and/ or clients on its own, the management has taken the acquisition route. Not completely unreasonable considering that the company wants to take the tech route for its growth. Also, from my limited viewpoint, none of the acquisitions appear to be haphazard in terms of the segments they wish to address.\nAlso, I am perhaps mistaken, but page 125 of KPIT FY14 AR says goodwill is about Rs28 crores not Rs599 crore. Am I looking at the wrong place? (standalone number page 83 is lower at about Rs 8 crore).\nTo address the debtors question, the debtor days are around 80-82. Actually I didn’t think that a 3.0 month customer payment cycle was significantly slower than normal. But that is probably because of my ignorance. However, one possible reason could be that nearly 33% of the business is tech based, so payments would be on completion of milestones basis rather than a normal ticketing job associated with routine software maintenance, error testing type of jobs.

Receivables are on the higher side. If you look at industry Infy is @60 days, TCS @82 days, Persistent @64. It looks higher. What is important is to see how the receivables have changed over time because with a lot of acquisitions you tend to acquire a lot of bad debt (looking at previous ARs can give us this info).

I will present some very broad thoughts on this theme here.\nFirst of all, I believe this merger is a very good thing from point of view of shareholders. If you remember one of the key worries I had about KPIT were the relentless acquisitions. It almost reminded me of Lynch’s “di-worse-ification” thesis Now, the company is doing the exact opposite. It is bringing back focus on its strengths. For the purpose of this discussion allow me to call the automotive side of KPIT as its core business and the business IT as the non-core part,\nNow KPIT is divesting its non core businesses to Birlasoft. Who runs Birlasoft? Anjan Lahiri. Anjan is the founder of mindtree, and if I recall correctly he was instrumental in turning Sasken around as well. As per this report 5, Sasken lost about 20% of its market cap on the day his departure.\nFrom the same article:\n“Lahiri, widely regarded as an ace salesman, started his career with Wipro Infotech in 1987. In 1999, he co-founded Mindtree with other former Wipro executives such as Krishnakumar Natarajan and Ashok Soota. Prior to his departure from Mindtree, he headed the company’s IT services business and was instrumental in winning a number of important deals from customers such as AIG, Microsoft and US-based IT firm SITA”\nNow my base case is that, at the very least, the non core of KPIT will become the core of Birlasoft and with a sharp mind like Anjan at the helm, will do much better than the current situation. This benefit will be translated to current shareholders of KPIT as they will get shares in Birlasoft.\nSecondly, with increased focus on the core business, KPIT will also do much better in the Auto space. I am inherently bullish on the auto software business. As electric vehicles roll on to the road, eventually driverless cars as well perhaps, the software in a car will become a big differentiating factor. It is also not a bodyshopping type of work and anyone can simply google to see the array of patents that KPIT has in this space.\nAn increased focus on the best performing division that is in the sweet spot of a multi year growth industry would bode well for KPIT and will not doubt be reflected in the financials over the next 2-3 years after the demerger.\nThis is by no means a recommendation, but just a humble attempt to put the developments into perspective.\nDisc: Invested in KPIT.','Apr 19, 2018 10:14 pm'),(2265,316,698,'The question is that who sold 14l shares?','Sep 21, 2020 9:13 pm'),(2266,316,118,'There’s been no bulk deals going the other way for those 14 lakhs.

With Quartz you dont have such headaches given the process of making quartz is by taking a rock,crushing it and adding a polymer resin to it and running it through a diamond polishing machine will permanently seal that product.Hence it does not promote growth of germs,bacteria.\n2.Since it is a man made stone,Quartz comes in variety of colors and size compared to Granite.It is very consistent in size and shape as well compared to natural stones.\nMarket share of Granite in US is 27% and Quartz is around 8%.In other developed countries like canada,Australia quartz share is more than 30%.\nGiven that pokarna markets both granite and quartz which are in high demand for kitchen countertops and its presence in US,it is very well placed to take advantage of this boom.\nThere are many unknown facts around its business:\n1.Pokarna has 2 manufacturing units with a total capacity of 6 lakhs sq.feet per annum.How much is this utilized?

I think, there are many disadvantages of using Quartz coming from Chinese plants. The most important one to me is that they use a lot more chemicals to manufacture their slabs.

I have covered more from the overall business perspective rather than putting numbers, which we all know.\nUS Market -\nUSA’s construction market is buoyant. Shift is happening there from Granite/Laminates to Quartz. New growth that is happening is all in Quartz is in double digits, whereas Granite’s is in lower single digit. Everybody (all stone dealers who didn’t want to deal in Quartz earlier) now want to sell Quartz. But still US continues to be a very big market for Granite. US stone market isn’t matured (good runway). Granite business facing stiff competition from Brazil.\nPlayers in US are trying to grab the lower end of the Quartz market as well (Chinese dominance currently). Will have to figure out right product mix across price spectrum. Price increases at will isn’t possible after product launching. So, despite higher RM prices (crude), they are unable to pass on the higher costs.\nCaesarstone EBIT margins are close to 18-20%, while that of Pokarna is 35%+. Can this be a threat? Management answered that Caesarstone’s pricing points are even higher than that of Pokarna, but still if they are unable to make higher profits may be due to efficiency, lower labor costs, RM pricing, higher overheads, etc.\nQuartz business -\nHigher input price (crude) for Quartz and adverse currency movement impacts them. This is why Q2 was low on EBITDA despite full Quartz ramp up vis a vis last year.\nAt peak utilization (Quartz), they posted 58-60 cr revenue (last year), while in this qtr it is close to 51 cr at almost peak utilization due to the issues mentioned above. Throughput wouldn’t be higher in Quartz despite removing bottlenecks. What they are trying to achieve is increased realizations due to improved aesthetics (close to natural stone). They have pushed around 21 new products in the market. Takes 3-6 months for the verdict to be out. They expect results from this endeavor starting Q1 next year. These new products will replace some of the older products with lower realizations. These new products tend to attain 10-15% higher price, but mgmt wants to wait till q4 concall to give any concrete details.\nEmployee cost has been rising as they have already hired staff for the new plant. There is a big learning curve and takes time as employees are very critical for managing the operations of Quartz business. They want staff to be trained and ready for the new plant on time. They said employee expenses will be more or less the same going forward.\nIncreased sales and advertising expenses to improve visibility is one of the factors for lower PAT yoy in Quartz division. Will continue to advertise aggressively going forward.\nGuidance for 35%+ EBITDA in any case.\nNew Quartz plant -\nSelected the location for new quartz facility. Legal due diligence underway. Plant will commence production post 18 months of the date of land finalization. Breton machine has been ordered but put on hold till land issue is resolved. Asset turns at peak utilization would be 1-1.25. Optimum utilization/stabilization from this new plant in itself will take 3-4 years from commencement. Ramp-up takes time.\nIncremental 250 cr debt they will take for the new facility will not show up on the Balance Sheet even until next year. Moratorium period is 3 years.\nOn capital structure - debt vs equity for the new plant, they wanted to take the financial closure asap (route that was quicker). They can decide if equity route is needed later as well.\nGranite vertical -\nImproved performance in Granite vertical in Q2 comes from improved production from new quarry as well as value addition (cut to size i believe). Market remains extremely competitive. Mgmt hopes the market remains like this (doesn’t deteriorate further) in order for continued improvement in this vertical.\nMiscellaneous -\nInterest outgo is continuously improving. 7 cr for this qtr vis a vis 9 cr last year. This will further reduce due to credit rating improvement in this qtr for the company and its subsidiary. Also, regarding transfer of all debt to dollar denomination, management has given a deadline (Dec 31st) to the bank consortium to give a final answer. Mgmt expects 4-5% (on absolute basis) rate reduction from the current rates. This would be big savings.\nGeographical expansion is on the cards. Have been looking at markets where they have not been traditionally present in a large way or not present at all. Europe, India, Australia (very small market).\nGST reduced from 28% to 18% is good for the industry.\nTotal debt is 217 cr. Planning to pay 35 cr of outside debt (total outside debt is 117 cr) this year.\nRevenue breakup - 99% of quartz revenue from exports. 61% of granite revenue from exports.\nBreton gives them upper-hand vis a vis Chinese manufacturers. In India, it is a challenging task to educate users regarding difference between Breton and Chinese. Take for instance IKEA. IKEA has selected us as it doesn’t use Quartz from Chinese players worldover. Be it composition, technology involved, polishing, installation, staining, cracking…Breton is much better.\nIKEA’s projections for India are very big.

Of course they can provided they put the time and effort to do the same.\nCan a facebook, google, hdfc bank or hdfc life get the code written for this? Absolutely yes. But they chose not to do this so that they focus on their core business. They outsource this work to say a Route or a Gupshup or Twilio internationally because they dont have the enthusiasm to sit and haggle with multiple telecom operators globally what should be the cost that will be charged per SMS or call.\nPromoters have ownership in few loss-making companies having presence in hotel, travel and gaming industries. Isn’t it lack of focus?\nYes it is lack of focus. In an ideal world you would not like such distractions. They own a hotel in Goa which is managed day to day by Accord Group. They also own stakes in a travel company and Cobx gaming. Most first generation enterpreneurs try their hand at 3 or 4 businesses. One works out which they focus on and ignore/ focus less on the remaining.\nThen again is this something an investor should be worried about.

The company offers a consumer and an enterprise platforms to its clients. With these products company tries to improve the ROI on digital marketing campaigns for clients, reduce the ad frauds, maintaining consumer privacy and more.\nAffle India was initially incorporated as “Tejus Securities Private Limited” in 1994.

Only 10% of Internet users are active (i.e., making a purchase at least once per month) e-commerce customers. Frost & Sullivan believes that this makes it a more challenging landscape for marketing tech to be able to discern the users who have the highest propensity to transact online. It can be a hard market to sustain, even for market participants who are globally successful.\nWith an average CPC at USD 0.1 to 0.3, the price points are quite low compared to the global market.\nFrost & Sullivan believes that achieving profitability in such a price-sensitive market is possible only for companies that are familiar with the dynamics of consumer profiles and have a track-record of working alongside brands locally for years. Ad tech, while being extremely attractive, hinges on the success of data acquisition and several vendors globally have demonstrated low profitability or losses even in high CPC markets.

Most of these employees in the “data operations” or anything related to “data” have no such relevant experience and the few (can count on single hand) that even mention such experience are very inexperienced and have joined only in the last year. Most of the employees appear to have joined in the last year or two. Where are the geeks that built their products? A product company such as this with claims as high ought to be screaming with talent that has stayed on for years, which is shockingly absent going by linkedin. None of the employees they claim to have in Singapore & Indonesia are on LinkedIn?

Why choose Affle over Google or Facebook remains an important question for me.\nTo take this competition aspect forward, does someone know if Google/Facebook work on performance based model (CPCU) or they still work on impression based models (CPM). Nomura report claims that only 10-15% of the ad tech market in India is performance based & Affle model is likely to force everyone else to performance based model. Is performance (CPCU) based model really an competitive advantage for Affle & for how long?\nBringing in further points, how do CPCU based pricing gets dictated in the industry? From Shemaroo experience, it looked like CPM rates moved down for YouTube over the years. What happens to CPCU rates if Google/Facebook reduce the rates?\nCan Google ask for a cut from players like Affle? Can Google hinder Affle from collecting data?\nThe second thing that hit me from Nomura report is that Affle might have minimal presence in Video ads. Does Affle have capability to place video ads on platform like Times Group? How about YouTube? Given that video is one of their strategic points & there is gold rush in video viewing, it is important to get split of video vs. non-video revenue.\nFinally, the question of Amazon - Amazon has 7% market share & it is third largest ad tech player in the US. Amazon has launched ad tech services in India. What happens to Affle over the long term?\nThe broader question is - Why would any publisher with large amount of data (Hotstar, Jio, Flipkart, Times Group etc.) will not create its own ad tech platform? Currently publishers seem to get 40% of the ad spend in value chain. Why not take that number to 70-80%?\nAnother aspect is wide variance in monetization factor in India (6.9%) vs. EM (1.8%) or DM (0.9%). Most people believe that monetization factor in EM or DM will improve to India. My question is - can reverse happen - where India monetization factor goes down? Why is it high in India? Is it simply matter of focus?\nI am also interested in numbers & capabilities of InMobi & other players - if someone has done work, kindly do share.\nDisc - No investments, not a buy or sell recommendation.','Nov 18, 2019 1:06 am'),(2448,319,738,'Having seen Digital Marketing life cycle and spends briefly - there are below key players broadly speaking\nAgencies - content, creative, campaign etc.- more of services characterized\nPublishers, Exchanges etc - ad inventories etc - more of sell side - Times group, Google and FBs of world( one facet as their biz is humongous)\nplatforms with Ad Tech/Mar tech - Again google And FB as well as Affles of the world.\nNow, we all can observe that money flows from brands to above 3 in some mix and configuration.

I know a thing or two about affle. While its true that this business and other types of this businesses will continue to grow on the back of high smartphone penetration (this is the main forte of affle and inmobi). However, the devil lies in the details Affle started out as tech oriented company that would give rich media assets to agencies and their respective brands (good margin business). Overtime they started accelerating in what we call ad network or affiliate business especially post 2014 when lot of VC money allowed app based businesses like flipkart, Ola, and Amazon to grow significantly. One of the domino effects it had was that there was a huge demand created to get more users for their apps and the primary channels to tap into these were google and facebook. However, the demand was so big that these businesses started to look for other channels outside Googe and Facebook. This is what gave tailwinds to businesses like inmobi, affle, Vserv, and Tyroo. Affle also benefited a great deal when SVG media group (Tyroo was part of it but then was hived off) got sold to Dentsu allowing only few players to capture the market and affle was very aggressive in wining big relationships especially Amazon India. Even today, majority of the User acquisition campaigns go through affle for Amazon india. This tail wind really propelled affle’s profitability and since then there has been no looking back. They had launched products in mobile attribution, fraud detection, DSP and many others but were mostly cloned from already some of the more established businesses in the ecosystem. With the help of the IPO capital raised, they have strategically started acquiring other tech companies i.e appnext is the most recent one. My only issue here is (speaking strictly from what I have observed with the inside the industry perspective) that their main cash cow still remains the ad network business but now they have amalgamated so many other tech businesses that its hard to separate wheat from the chaff. The market is giving it a premium valuation because of all the tech but I know the core of it still remains purely ad network business and that too because one special relationship it shares with Amazon India. Overall, I am very skeptical of their offerings its true that Inmobi is more of a tech player in this field but even Inmobi has a significant chunk of their revenues coming from ad network business.

I know a thing or two about affle. While its true that this business and other types of this businesses will continue to grow on the back of high smartphone penetration (this is the main forte of affle and inmobi). However, the devil lies in the details Affle started out as tech oriented company that would give rich media assets to agencies and their respective brands (good margin business). Overtime they started accelerating in what we call ad network or affiliate business especially post 2014 when lot of VC money allowed app based businesses like flipkart, Ola, and Amazon to grow significantly. One of the domino effects it had was that there was a huge demand created to get more users for their apps and the primary channels to tap into these were google and facebook. However, the demand was so big that these businesses started to look for other channels outside Googe and Facebook. This is what gave tailwinds to businesses like inmobi, affle, Vserv, and Tyroo. Affle also benefited a great deal when SVG media group (Tyroo was part of it but then was hived off) got sold to Dentsu allowing only few players to capture the market and affle was very aggressive in wining big relationships especially Amazon India. Even today, majority of the User acquisition campaigns go through affle for Amazon india. This tail wind really propelled affle’s profitability and since then there has been no looking back. They had launched products in mobile attribution, fraud detection, DSP and many others but were mostly cloned from already some of the more established businesses in the ecosystem. With the help of the IPO capital raised, they have strategically started acquiring other tech companies i.e appnext is the most recent one. My only issue here is (speaking strictly from what I have observed with the inside the industry perspective) that their main cash cow still remains the ad network business but now they have amalgamated so many other tech businesses that its hard to separate wheat from the chaff. The market is giving it a premium valuation because of all the tech but I know the core of it still remains purely ad network business and that too because one special relationship it shares with Amazon India. Overall, I am very skeptical of their offerings its true that Inmobi is more of a tech player in this field but even Inmobi has a significant chunk of their revenues coming from ad network business.

Called Indian Yeast Co. It is no more in operation. Presently India produces around 85-90,000 tons of yeast per year at five factories directly or indirectly own by two groups. and market demand is partly met by imports mainly from China, Turkey and some other countries.\nThe major groups engaged in production of yeast and yeast based derivatives in the world are\nAssociated British foods Plc( UK),\nAlletech Inc( Canada),\nAngle yeast co( china),\nCher Hansen A/s( Denmark),\nLallemand Inc( Canada),\nLesaffre group( France),\nOriental yeast( Japan)\nRoyal DSM( Holland),\nLiber GMBH( Germany)\nCommercial yeast\nAvailable as cream yeast This product has 18-20 % dry matter and used extensively in Europe, America where large automated bakery plants are operated, consuming several tons of wheat flour per shift. Cream yeast is easy to handle, can be stored, chilled and transferred using pumps saves on packing material, labour costs and ease of use in automated systems. Bio-ethanol plants also consume large quantity of yeast in cream form as they are highly automated. Yeast cream requires storage in chilled condition good hygienic storage system and has shelf life of about 5-7 days.\nCompressed yeast The product has 28-33% dry matter. Available in form of 25gm/500gm/1000gm cakes resembling bricks in shape are most suitable for home baking, small and medium size bakeries. Product can be stored in refrigerator for 10-15 days without significant loss of activity\nCrumbled yeast mass This yeast is sometimes also demanded by bulk users yeast cake in uneven or extruded in form of fine particles is packed in 20-25 kg bags and supplied , It is easy to weigh accurately and suitable for machine feed operations. The product has characteristics similar to compressed yeast in terms of activity and shelf life\nActive dry yeast This product was developed to overcome problem of refrigerated storage and relatively short shelf life of compressed yeast The product is in form of medium to fine globules/ granules having 92-95% dry matter. Normally it is used in remote areas where fresh yeast is not available and refrigeration facility is absent. This production process involves carefully drying extruded yeast cell mass under controlled condition in roller drum dryers or fluidized bed driers , Process of drying over longer period results in some loss of activity, but the main advantage is 3-4 months of shelf life at ambient temperature ,no need of refrigeration. The product is normally paced in tins of various sizes or in poly jars of 12-15 kg.Product is suitable for bakeries using long duration fermentation process of bread making in remote areas.\nInstant dry yeast It is a dry yeast with very high dry matter ( 96-97%) is produced in form of fine vermicelli dried at low temperature under controlled conditions and packed under vacuum. The activity of yeast is very good, and like fresh compressed yeast start its function in dough almost immediately and so called “ Instant Yeast “ The fine vermicelli gets dispersed easily in the dough and so acts fast on dough. It has long shelf life and can be safely store at ambient temperature for up to two years. This product has replaced large market of active dry yeast\nApplication/utilization\nProduction of baked goods- largest and most well known world wide application\nAlcoholic fermentation’s– Mainly for production of ethanol from beet and cane molasses and cane/ beet juice, using grain hydrolysates especially corn, millet’s,wheat,and rice, tubers like potato,cassava,sweet potato ,and latest substrate being cellulose.\nWine industry,- Making wine from grapes, and several other fruits like apples etc and finally many a times distilled out to make specialized branded products.\nPrepared foods- Yeast hydrolysates, Yeast extracts rich in nucleotides are extensively used as natural flavoring substances replacing mono-sodium Glutamate and those flavors originating from meat and animal proteins\nFood supplements,- Yeast is rich source of proteins,B group vitamin’s , and fiber and finds wide application as rich nutrient supplement in form of inactivated flaked yeast. In fact during last century yeast tablets was popular recommendation for those needing vitamins supplements when pure form of vitamin preparations were not avalible.\nAnimal feed- yeast has shown excellent probiotic action. Feeding of selected strains of yeast have shown improved productivity in ruminants ( dairy cattle cows,buffalo’s, sheep) with increased milk yield and improvement in fat content of milk, better weight gain in animals raised exclusively for meat production purpose, In poultry it has shown beneficial effect both in broilers and layer birds. In case of broilers it helps better food conversion ( weight gain) and reduced use of antibiotics for protection. In case of layers in addition improved health and better egg production is observed. This is one of the major innovative application of yeast that has been well established in last thirty years or so. Yeast cell wall is rich in beta glucan which stimulates non specific immunity in animals and so yeast cell wall extract rich in beta-glucan is being used in feed and nutrient supplement to bust non specific immunity.\nPharma and bio-pharma Industry Yeast extract is a reach source of balanced nutrient and is extensively used as safe ingredient in media for cultivation of various microorganisms and tissue culture work importance of yeast extract increased many folds with mad cow disease scare.\nIn very recent years beta-glucan rich products are being marketed as part of cosmetics and in anti-aging skin preparations\nProduction of enzyme Invertase, glutathione , enzymatic conversion process for production of epihydrine and sudo-epihydrine\nIn recent times yeast isolated from Antarctica continent are being extensively explored for production of wide range of extra cellular alph amylase,lipase, xylenase, protease etc. Being able to operate at relatively low temperature is a very attractive commercial application in wide range of industries.\nOther major yeast based products are yeast extract,yeast autolysate, yeast beta glucan, food supplement vitamin enriched yeast, yeast with high Selenium and chromium enrichment, in cosmetic.\nFor production of molecules of commercial interest e.g is in synthesis of Artemisinim- a precursor for Malaria drug.\nYeast base cancer fighting technology is in advance stage( Apolife), vaccine production ( rabies), Insulin production.\nYeast is prime target for research in similar applications as it has several advantages over other similar hosts like E. coli, CHOCELLS, Pichia yeast, due to easy secretion/separation of recombinant proteins of interest.\nYeast Genome\nProven safety for thousands of years, multipal applications, relative ease of propagation, and abundance in nature has attracted attention of yeast as a group of microorganism of choice to play with.\nBakers yeast “Saccharomyces cervisiae” is a power full research tool because of its ability to quickly map a phenotype producing gene to a part of yeast genome. In 1986 international group of scientist from 92 laboratories from countries such as UK, USA, Canada, Japan, France have successfully done gene mapping of this yeast species.

PL has 10 manufacturing units spread across 8 locations.\nStarch Sugar division constitutes products such as Sorbitol70%, Dextrose Monohydrate (DMH), Malto Dextrine Powder(MDP) and Liquid Glucose. GPL is the biggest producer in most of these products according to my knowledge in India. These products are widely used across the industries.\n2. Calcium Carbonate and it’s by products:\nGPL manufactures different types of Calcium Carbonates using Lime stone. Premium quality Activate Calcium Carbonate (ACC), Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC), which finds applications in Plastic industry, Paint, Rubber, Cosmetics and Printing ink etc. GPL manufacturing activity spread across 4 plants with a capacity of 1, 05,000 MTPA backed by power plants.\nOnsite PCC concept:\nGulshan Polyols Ltd is the first to introduce the concept of On-site PCC plant in India, at the site of Magnum Papers ltd. This has been recorded in the Limca Book of Records, 2010.Gulshan provides the know-how to set up an On-site PCC plant and maintains the supply of the raw material for the same. After success of its first partnership in this field, it is tying knot with other paper mills for On-site PCC technology.\nGulshan is supplying PCC for alkaline paper to Paper Mills like ITC Ltd, TNPL, BILT, Shree Krishna Paper Mills Ltd etc.\nOnsite PCC Projects:\n(1) ITC Ltd.

Current blending capacity is 1.5 Lakh cases per month. Company has plans to manufacture Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA) in the same location with capacity of 60,000 KLPD and commencement by March 2016.\n4. Animal Feed:\nGood thing about the company which I like mostly is the management is continually introducing new products in starch/rice segment and increasing the value products thereafter. The raw material for this division is derived from “By-product of the wet milling of corn to produce cornstarch, sweeteners, oil and applying steam drying OR produced in the processing course of corn starch”.\nThis division manufactures the products such as Cattle Feed, Corn Gluten, Rice Gluten, Corn Gemand others.Company claims their cattle feed products are vitamin rich such as amino acids, Proteins which are necessary for animal growth and their milk yield.\nBoth Animal Feed and IMFL divisions will provide additional revenues on both sides(top &bottom) considering that they are still in nascent stage.\nAchievements:\nGPL is the first Indian company to produce Dextrose Monohydrate (DMH)\nfrom rice.\nGPL has been recorded in Limca Book of Records, 2010, for pioneering in setting up the first on-site PCC plant in the country.\nGPL is the single largest producer of Sorbitol and Calcium Carbonate in the Country in the organized sector, which meets the requirements of all the customers in the various industries, and the customer’s list includes top corporations in Tooth Paste, Pharmaceuticals, Paper and Paints etc.\nThe Company has its own power generation plants of 15 MW located at Muzaffarnagar and Bharuch plants that makes it self sufficient in meeting the energy demand 24x7.\nLong term agreements with most of its marquee clients.\nRecent Developments:\nCompany shares allotted to Antara fund @175 rs.\nCompany shares listed on NSE exchange.\nPromoters had given 6% of stake to reliance growth fund @255 rs.\nDividend payout increased from 2.5 to 3.5 rs for the completed FY.\nConclusion : Stock is currently trading at 315 rs with a PE of 12 in the current bull market.

They also had to depend only on GPL considering it is the biggest player in the country with all the approval certificates.\n// Firstly, the company’s tax rate is very low which to me suggest some manipulation in its numbers.\nI always felt some TAX rebates in states such as Himachal Pradesh, Baruch in gujarat are the reasons for the same.

You can check the numbers on screener for more if interested.\nWhat attracted me to Adlabs and eventually to Wonderla was the operating leverage inherent in the business. Once the park has been built and the capital invested, it takes very little to run a park operationally. It is mostly operational maintenance expense, employee salaries and the like. So as long as the revenue keeps increasing, the marginal revenue keeps on flowing straight to the bottom line if there is no debt as is the case here and once the park building expenses are amortized.\nThe growing revenues year on year is a big assumption but it is something that depends on management quality and competence.\nGrowing revenues could be due to:\nMore visitors\nIncrease in ticket prices\nbuilding new parks at different locations\ncombination of few or all of the above.\nThe company is setting up a new park in Hyderabad which will be operational by April 2016 and there is planning going on of opening a new park in Chennai.\nKochi and Bengaluru are the two well established parks since 2000 and 2005. The funding for the two parks in Hyderabad and Chennai are to be meet from internal accruals arising out of the two established parks along with the resort at Bengaluru.\nThe opening up of the two parks along with growth in visitors/ticket prices at the established parks will help revenues grow over the years.\nThere is novelty for this as outdoor activity and adventure tourism picks up in India.

The Q1 EBITDA declined by 2.71% YOY to about Rs 39.2 crores. EBITDA margin declined by 1584bps to 44.1%. The EBITDA margin got impacted mainly because of our overall increase in operating expenses on account of the addition of Hyderabad Park.\n• PAT margins got impacted mainly due to higher depreciation, due to the addition of Hyderabad Park and also due to the decline in other income during this quarter as Q1 FY 16 other income largely included dividend from our IPO proceeds.\n• The overall footfalls of course increased by around 12% to 7.92 lakhs from 7.06 lakhs last year. This is mainly because of the increase in footfalls by 2 lakhs from Hyderabad. Overall revenue grew by around 31% roughly around from Rs 68 crores to Rs 90 crores that is also mainly banking on Hyderabad.\nHyderabad Park Updates:\n• 200,000 visitors visiting the Park during 2.5 months of opening.\n• Spread over 49.5 acres of land with Current development on 27 acres of Land.\n• The park initially comprises of 43 rides which includes 18 wet rides and 25 dry rides.\n• The park boasts of India’s first ever reverse looping roller coaster named RECOIL, with maximum height of 40 metres and with 6 inversions per ride, imported from the Netherlands.\n• It is also the first park in India with Cashless RFID based transactions facility\n• Hyderabad has given total revenue of close to Rs 19.5 crores.\n• Average ticket revenue in Hyderabad collected net of taxes is around Rs 650 and sale of Food something close to Rs 110and sale of product is highest among the three Parks at Rs 163. Overall per head revenue at Hyderabad is now close to Rs 948.\n• Rs4 crore was the Hyderabad opening marketing expenses probably and another Rs 4 crore in next two quarters together.\n• Hyderabad Park is around Rs 92 higher in term of Non-Ticket revenue mainly due to sale of merchandise.\nBangalore Park Updates:\n• Bangalore Park witnessed roughly 25% increase in average ticket Price and 18% increase in average Non-Ticket revenue.\n• Coming back to the most important part of the footfalls break up for Bangalore and Hyderabad, of course Bangalore has shown a 12% decline and general footfalls have gone below from 4.17 to 3.67 lakhs.\n• Out of the 12% decline around roughly 10% decline happened in the area of Adult and Child that is the full paying customers.\n• But despite this, the revenue of Bangalore has shown an increase of 8.5%. This is mainly because of the increase in average revenue.\n• Most significant thing is that the Coming to the Resort part, the first quarter clocked around 67% occupancy vs 48% occupancy during last year so the acceptance of Resort is improving among the local public as well as the Corporate.\n• Bangalore Park there was around 50,000footfall reduction out of which around 35,000 was Walk-in customers, 8,000 was Corporates and balance from Schools. With respect to Corporates that was mainly because of the shift from Corporates to next quarter. We don’t feel the business is moving away from us. Bangalore last year had 11,000 students which was only 9,000 students this year, so the only difference is 2,000.\n• Over a period, you can see that in Bangalore there is average increase in the Restaurants revenue of 30% compared to 10% increase in the ticket revenue. So Food. Of course Food revenue will be increasing than rest and next quarter you will see the difference in Bangalore which is following the Hyderabad way and in Q3 or between the Q3 or Q4 you can see the same in Cochin.\n• Average food revenue in Bangalore is Rs 88 and that in Hyderabad is Rs 105\nCochin Park Updates:\n• Cochin Park saw a 21% increase in average ticket Price and 32% increase in average Non-Ticket revenue. Footfalls in Bangalore decreased by about 12% and Cochin Park declined by about 24%.\n• Kochi had a sharper decline in footfall as it showed around 24.5% or around 70,000 reduction in footfall. Out of 70,000, 50,000 footfall reductions were in the core category of the full paid customers which included 40,000 reductions in Adult category and 10,000 reductions in Child category. So this being the case, Cochin had a negative growth in revenue by close to around 8%.\n• Our entire Summer Campaign Advertising and Marketing campaign was based on Water Park and we have to withdraw that campaign because we fell that it might raise too many eyebrows especially during a drought situation\n• Cochin specially we also feel we have done lot of research on this there is a slight issue of product mix also I think we need to change, we need to refresh the Park little bit and we working on that.\n• As per our Market Surveywe will have to concentrate on an area of 100 km to 125 km rather than 250 km to 300 km were we able to do in Bangalore and probably in Hyderabad. So Cochin had 2-3 issues one is price hikes and the other issue that came up was that our Park is lightly seen as an old Park. It’s already 16years old. So it need a bit of refresh. I don’t think we become late in doing that infact in any kind of investment for e.g. in Cochin we have to do a Roller Coaster it’s a 25 to 30 crore investment so unless it really needed we don’t want to do it. we already bought some property extra which is done last year but that conversion and this integrating into our Park area is happening now. So now is the good time to add Rides to Kochi which for example there was no space for us to add a Roller Coaster until 6 months back, we never had the space for it. So those constraints are also there in place like Kochi. And then on to top of that we have issues you know like compute and things like that.\n• The Roller Coaster that we are thinking of buying it will take us at least another 6 months and we will be able to open it only by the end of this financial year. So this year, in addition to that we are adding two more attractions we should be ready by October. So I think that will help us creating a new Marketing Campaign and reinvigorate the\nGrowth, Capex, Cross-Sell/Upsell Guidance:\nGrowth:\n• The existing Park of course I expect 3 to 4% considering the present situation in the next five years. You take a five year CAGR growth, I think the footfall can grow by 3 to 4% only.\n• The new Parking Hyderabad can contribute around average of 10 to 12% for the next five years and by the time I expect Chennai also to functional from FY19 with a footfall something better than Hyderabad.\nCapex:\n• Chennai property, we will have an average CAPEX of around 170 crores in the coming year FY 17. That depends on when we are closing the Chennai property and existing Park Hyderabad probably we will spend around Rs 30 to 40 crores and around Rs 30 to 35 crores we expect to spend in Kochi.\n• 150 to 170 cr. will be the average spend of this year FY 17.\n• In Hyderabad, we are investing Rs 250 crores and we spent only Rs 225 crore so far. So those two will continue and Kochi we are investing around Rs 30 crores that we expect to regain the footfall of around 1.5 lakh which will give an additional revenue of Rs 15 to 18 crore to us\nCross-sell/Upsell:\n• Hyderabad has around 71% in the collection from ticket and 29% from Non-Ticket.\n• So, in next 2 years, when we takeover all the Restaurants in Kochi and Bangalore and we will be looking for a mix of something close to 30% to 32% from Non-Ticket revenue.\nOnline Digital and Marketing Plans:\n• We have no track of absolute repeat customers. We are tracking them through the loyalty program that we run and we have around 1.3 lakh cards in circulation and that card when used that is the area where we get exact number of repeat, but what we have we feel Bangalore we have around 40 to50% repeat customer. Repeat I mean not in the same year but those repeat after 3-4 years.\n• In immediate future we don’t want invest in biometric and similar kinds of things but currently now we are first trying to make maximum bookings through online. Because you look at Parks outside there are maximum bookings is online Ticket. So we have not reached that level that is our identification on that.\n• That is where we can offer to the plan where we have online available now we are promoting the online booking and digital marketing are on the high priority for us. These two will enabled us to get more Mail ids and communication possibility to those customers. Currently we have very limited in that probably we will have mail box of close to around 2 lakhs customers only.\nPersonal Views:\n• Future growth numbers of footfall need to be revisited\n• There is tendency of footfall reduction once parks are 10 year old\n• Price Elasticity Impact assessment is required\n• Cross-sell opportunities looks good and may give better feel to valuations\n• Still, there is scope for incremental revenue as current efforts does not involve any sort of major CRM, digital or analytical based marketing focus\n• Hyederabad initial footfall may be due to buzz and as Hyderabad already has multiple parks, future numbers may set long term trend\n• A friend of mine visited Hyderabad park and liked overall location of park and the rides\n• Going forward, for next 2-3 years, there might be slight stretch in debt equity ratio, though, it should stay under comfortable limits\n• Disney is known for data driven customer management. Seeing current fll in footfall, may be time has come for wonderla to do an intelligence based customer management, pricing management\n• Growth assumption numbers and cross-sell/upsell assumption numbers in valuation models may need a re-look\nDisc : Invested with 2% of portfolio.

You have already covered some of the points in investment rationale but few additional important points in my thesis are\nWorld over, even for mature parks (Disney, Six Flags, Sea World etc), the foofall have seen growth of 4-6%. As compared to that, Indian market is still at early stage of the maturity cycle and hence getting 4-6% increase is doable.\nIf we look at past track record, they have been able to increase ticket price above inflation rate. Typically at 10%+ CAGR. Now a decent part of their P&L cost does not increase (fixed asset depreciation), but on that cost too, they get 10% higher realization. So, margin improvement or at least margin maintenance on steady state basis looks reasonably certain for existing park.\nSo if we combine above two points (And connect them with few below), it is reasonable to assume 15-16% growth from existing parks on normalized basis. Then the additional kicker will come from new parks which means 20-25% growth is achievable in medium term on steady state basis.\nThe most likable feature to me- they increased prices last year by whopping 25%, and the retail foot fall only marginally declined. You don’t need any other proof for pricing power! This to me is a clear reflection of price in elasticity of demand - or in other words pricing power. When you can increase prices without affecting demand substantially, you have found true pricing power.\nThey generate super cash flows and Return on Capital employed. Though the current return ratios look higher due to depreciated asset base, even on new asset they will generate 25% ROIC. And to top it due to expansion they can keep on deploying this capital and generate such decent returns on additional capital. It is not easy to find such business models where businesses can deploy large capital at high rate of return.\nOne of the ignored part of the story is their own manufacturing capacity for rides which brings down the Capex and Opex both for them. Consider a Hyderabad park that is set up 2 years after Adlabs set up Imagica with almost similar number of rides. Wonderla spent 300 odd crores on Hyderabad park while Adlabs was set up with 1200 Crore + Capex two years ago. Though the scale may be bigger for Adlabs Imagica- the cost differential is disproportionate. More importantly, it is not coming at the expense of customer experience- as is amply evident from the Tripadvisor ratings. Just imagine the headway wonderla as company has over peers where they have 30-40-50% cost advantage in one of their biggest cost items\nBy nature, large amusement park is a natural monopoly business- because it involves assets that are inflationary. So, it is extremely difficult for new player to enter the same market and compete. Let’s say Adlabs wants to enter Bangalore market today, it will have to spend almost 3-4 times the capital that Wonderla spent 10 years ago. And to top it, they will have to spend large sum of money on advertising/promotion to snatch away customers from Wonderla. Now, even if we assume they can take away 50% of the visitors from Wonderla, the economics will just not work for them because of higher fixed cost and higher operating cost structure. Thus, any company that enters a market first, has a big headway. Here, wonderla has an edge because they have carved out a business model that is replicable- and is expanding rapidly. So in next 10 years if they become 7-8 location company and corner some of the choicest markets, they have a substantial competitive advantage and pricing power!\nTo top these all, this business is run by a management of high integrity and competence.\nDisclaimer: I am not a research analyst of Investment advisor and this post should not be taken as buy/sell recommendation.

It has 39 acres, 64 acres and 23 acres land for future expansion at Bangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad…” which in my opinion is worth at least 2000 crs.\nPeople in the amusement park business typically buy 3x-5x the land they require, so that when they start operations the real estate prices in the neighborhood go up dispropotionately. They can then sell pieces of this land for capex needs. Thats why wonderla has negligible debt on its books. In fact, it can expand in other areas without taking on any additional debt whatsoever because it can do this land arbitrage.\nSecondly, again quoting from their annual report - amusement parks require an average investment of 70 Crs ( 0.70 billion) and need to be spread across 40 acres. It generated a cash of precisely 74.34 crs in a SINGLE year (2015-2016 ) which it used promptly to buy land ( Purchase of fixed assets 147 .01 crs of which 137 crs is capital work in progress).\nThis company is a land buying machine. It buys land , increases the value of the land it owns and the surrounding land ( that it has already bought by its cash flows), through its amusement park business (which on its own is worth at least 1000 crs).

In fact, the bigger the competition the better for Wonderla.

Since I never invested in Wonderla, I don’t have a bullish or a bearish bias.\nDepreciation as a % of sales for Wonderla is 7-9% in line with mature parks in US. Adlabs is high either because their asset base is high or their sales is low or they are using accelerated depreciation to save on taxes or all of the above.\nAsset Turnover (how much sales does the assets generate) for Wonderla is somewhat higher than mature parks in US indicating it is able to squeeze more juice out of lemon. Adlabs is asset heavy. It needs a sales boost to justify investment.\nAdvertisement as % of Sales - Wonderla is able to generate good sales without spending too much on advertisement. Looks like they are getting a good word-of-mouth advertising.\nAverage age in years - Wonderla has old assets compared to mature parks in US and much older than Adlabs. Unlike a natural person, average age of a going concern should remain same as old assets are depreciated and replaced with new assets.\nAvg Depreciable life in years - This is the life expectancy assumption used in asset accounting. Wonderla is assuming that its rides will keep generating revenue a little longer than others. This may be a little aggressive.\nRelative Age % - This is the part of the asset’s life that is used up. Wonderla’s assets are used up more than others to some extend.\nGrowth vs Maintenance Capex - I am assuming that any increase in net block and capitl wip is growth capex and everything else is maintenance. For a mature park, maintenance capex should be equal to depreciation expense so net income equals free cash flow. Wonderla is close to that.\nWonderla is almost doubling its net block with the upcoming park. financials for this new park may look that of Adlabs in terms of depreciation and advertisement so over the next 2-3 years, Wolderla may report lower profitability.\nWonderla may also have to be bump up depreciation of its current parks as it appears to be under depreciating.\nAdlabs growth is impressive.\nMy concern is newer parks of Wonderla will not be as profitable as existing parks going by how Adlabs is performing.

Over the weekend, spent some time analyzing the positive things about the business / stock.\nMy two cents on Positive factors:\nLong runway for growth with multiple growth levers: Wonderla Holidays is in a sweet spot with a long runway for growth.\nSome of the Growth levers available:\nNew parks– In the last 16 years the company has opened 3 parks. The latest one was in 2016 at Hyderabad and has helped the company with increased footfalls. The next one is planned at Chennai for which land has been procured and is projected to be operational by FY 2020. The company has stated in their annual reports their desire to open a park every four years.\nNew Rides– In the existing parks to keep it fresh, new rides are planned and launched. On an average at least 1 new ride is introduced every year in the existing parks. This adds to the novelty factor as well as aids in bringing in repeat customers.\nNon utilized land in existing parks– As per 2016-17 annual report the details of non utilized land available for future development:\nBangalore – 42.55 acres out of total land of 81.75 acres\nKochi – 64.42 acres out of total land of 93.17 acres\nHyderabad- 22.50 acres out of total land of 49.50 acres\nThere is a combined 130 acres (57% of land parcel) available for future development which is significant and can be used for expansion / new rides / new resorts in the existing parks.\nIncreased Non ticketing Revenue mix– Non ticket revenue sources include food, beverages, and merchandise from park visitors. Globally the revenue mix of ticket revenue to non- ticket revenue is 45: 55. In India the ratio has been 80:20. This shows the potential available for generating more revenue per visitor which is non- linear in nature.\nTo their credit, Wonderla has reported a 63% increase in non-ticket revenue last year. Also as per the annual report the average non-ticket revenue per visitor has gone up from INR 155 to INR 214 in FY 2017. Compared to global standards there is still room for further growth of non-ticket revenue share for Wonderla.\nIncreased revenue from Resort business– Wonderla operates a 3 star 84 room resort in its Bangalore Park. The resort also has a well-equipped board room along with conference facilities for targeting the corporate segment in addition to targeting the traditional retail recreational & leisure segment. As per the latest annual report the resort business generated 11.97 Cr in FY 17 with a 56% occupancy rate.\nThere is further scope for growth in occupancy rate as well as launch of new resorts in existing parks of Kochi & Hyderabad based on market demand.\nOther Positives:\nStrong tailwinds for the Industry– Amusement parks and theme parks are part of the leisure and entertainment industry. Globally the Industry is expected to grow at CAGR of 7.5% to reach INR 3.86 trillion. The Indian industry according to research studies are expected to grow at a much faster rate than the global average at CAGR of 19% to reach INR 70 billion by year 2021 from the present INR 30 billion.\nWith rising per capita income, increasing urbanization and sustained focus by government on improving the physical infrastructure / last mile connectivity, the Industry as such is having strong tailwinds for growth which should be favorable for Wonderla as well.\nManagement – Among many other things, one of the most significant criteria an investor should look before investing is the quality & integrity of the management as well as to see if there are any actions in the past which are minority shareholders’ unfriendly.\nWonderla is run by the Chittilappilly family, the same group behind V-Guard (listed since 2008) and have a reputation for being able and prudent. Also there have been no instances of any shareholder unfriendly actions.\nThey have been conservative in capital allocation but forward looking with a good pulse of the trends in the Industry. The management is now investing in the next generation technologies of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) with the first video being shot at Hollywood.\nVirtually Zero debt Company– The latest debt to equity ratio stands at a very healthy 0.04. Being in a capital intensive business it is commendable that the capital allocation policy has been prudent with growth coming through internal accruals. Even if the management decides to take on debt for future parks the company has sufficient leverage leeway.\nCost savings through Internal R&D – The management has done a brilliant thing of investing in own R&D capabilities to design and build rides. This gives the company significant cost advantages as it does not have to depend fully on local vendors or foreign suppliers.\nAs per the annual reports the company is able to internally design and build one-third of the new rides in a park with a cost savings of around 30%. This internal capabilities also lead to faster execution of new rides as well as quicker maintenance / refurbishment of existing rides.\nPlease highlight if any other key advantage has been missed out.\nThe rest of my thoughts like the business model , financial metrics and key concerns, if you are interested can be accessed here https://www.stockandladder.com/stock-thoughts-on-wonderla-holidays/ 25\nCheers','Aug 22, 2017 11:59 am'),(2579,323,776,'Can VR disrupt this business?\ntwitter.com 10\nHarsh Mariwala (hcmariwala) 10\nCan virtual reality be used to overcome your fears?

The operating margins of wonderla are in the range of 40-45% at peak so there should be a reversion to that and they will be once again under pressure as the Chennai park comes online when it does. I think the mgt has done a wise thing by focusing on cost effeciencies and remaining debt free.

The balance sheet of this business is unique, more like agriculture and mining where asset remains an asset forever.\nOne should keep in mind that out of 1900 cr, 1400 cr is invested in land that grows constantly with RoI of 10% and remaining 500 cr is invested in amusement business that currently earns 38 cr in FY18 at 8% RoI (worst margin in a decade) but has potential to give 12% RoI in the near future and also can be between 10-25% in the next 10 yrs.

The things that I like about the company are\nPromoter integrity\nThe promoters have around 69.52 % stake. The company is owned by v guard group family . They are not known for any corp governance issues so far. So not expecting any nasty suprises there other than MD being away for some time as pointed out in the forum already. It seems like he is already back in the business. The company is already established a brandname and has a goodwill. Promoter holding is at 69.58 % with some recent insider buying. FIIs hold around 15.39 % stake in the company.\n2)Zero debt\nEven when the business is considered as asset heavy, the company has managed to payoff debt prudently and is now a debt free company. However they plan to raise some fresh debt for the proposed Chennai park. The company has been very careful while raising debt.\n4)The rides in the park are known to be best in safety. An incident in any other park can also be a negative for the company in the short term. Talked to a project manager at Dubai Parks and resorts some time back and had mentioned that Wonderla may probably be the only park in India where he would be ready to get on the rides. Having said that any accident can be a severe deterrent.\n5)Management’s expansion strategy\nThe management has a good vision on growing business and expansion. To open a new park every 3 year. But due to the land acquisition and other regulatory guidelines, this may not be possible everytime. The Chennai park has lagged a lot. Now that the construction has started, management expects the park to be completed in 18 months. And company is exempted from levy of entertainment tax for a period of 5 years from the commencement of commercial operations or from 30 th September 2021. Company is also evaluating the possibility of opening an asset light model at Orissa by raising some debt and through internal accruals. I like the idea of company going forward to open up smaller parks in Tier 2 or 3 cities. Ticket prices will be lesser than what it is now which will improve affordability.\n6)Large Landbank\nCompany is having a very large unused landbank at all it’s parks. As per last revaluation the value of land assets is higher than the market cap.\nUnused land at it various parks\nBengaluru: 42.5 acres\nKochi :64.4 acres\nHyderabad :22.5 acres\nChennai: 64 acres\nThe land kept idle doesnot add any additional value as many in the forum has already highlighted. The current business model they have adopted requires a lot of land. These parks needs new rides to be installed every few years to improve the visibilty. To purchase new land around developed parks once the park is operational is not going to be economically vaiable. So they have to buy a land parcel in the begining itself. Whole land cant be developed together as it will entail a lot of investment which will mean higher debt and longer period to break even. So I like the way they open the park and then develop the park slowly based on requirement and using internal accruals. I think availablity of unused land is very much essential for them to take the parks to the next level. Once there is enough footfalls company may develop the land and rent out some of the properties which will be a very source of revenue. I have seen this at Dubai Parks and resorts where they have developed the land inside the park and has rented out the same to numerous hotels and restaurants. They have already opened resorts at Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\nConsidering the very large population we have I believe there is very good scope for the business going forward. Company is also trying to increase sales through various promotional offers like discount to groups, students etc. Iam quite positive on the Chennai park, but the commencement may get further delayed due to the lockdown\nOPM is above 40 %. There is considerable increase in non ticketing revenue. One major risk cited by many is the entry of some biggy like Disney. But I believe it may take many years for Disney for land acquistion and be operational due to the many regulatory bottlenecks which is evident from the Chennai Park. Similarly Wonderla can also consider tie ups with Marvel or Lionsgate for themed rides as well as for hosting their characters. But for any large tie ups like this , I think they will need more parks and more footfalls.\nROCE goes down whenever company starts land acquisition for a new park due to large gestation period and large upfront investment required on land and machinery. Once the park starts maturing , ROCE goes on increasing due to relatively low additional capital required. I believe ROCE will start improving once Chennai Park becomes operational.\nThey are considering an asset light park in Orissa for the first time, so if thats successful, company may build more asset light parks from hereon. The company can hive off unused land available at the existing parks and sell them anytime they want if they dont feel that the land can’t be made to any better use at the park( company has repeatedly reiterated that they have no such intentions). With no reliable, successful business models for an amusement park to follow so far in our country , they are in the process of developing one based on models in many other countries and the business is only moving from an embryonic to growth phase.\nNow with market cap at a discount to gross block the company surely looks attractive. Price is at a discount of 20% to book value and available at IPO prices.\nKey risks\nThe current covid19 crisis will be a testing time for the company. Children being the ones mostly attracted to the parks , the company’s revenue will be considerably hit until covid 19 is totally sorted out as social distancing will not make any sense at an amusement park. We may see very muted or NIL revenue for a couple of quarters to the least.\nAffordability\nThe ticket rates at Bengaluru park is already around 1300/*.

This is a very good sign of a\ndecent business for investment.\nInvestment rationale:\n Company has been doing working capital expenditure since last many years and its chemical plant has been upgraded with new machines and equipment so no new heavy expenditure in near future. Tank farm require constant upgradation and safety instruments installation so going forward we can assume that 5 crore per annum expenditure would be more than sufficient. Extra cash would be used to enter at new place. Expansion is in the pipeline for new places and capacity expansion at existing facilities. Promoter have been increasing their stake since last few years.\n Company’s Specialty chemical business was suffering due to high input cost low realization and one major cause was working capital stress. As company is progressing they are generating very good amount of cash which can easily take\ncare for the future growth plan.\n Debt is down from 470 crores in 2007 to 150crore in 2016 with the help of cash generated by Liquid storage business and write offs of debt by the lenders.Total Equity has come to negative 30 crore on sept-2016 from negative 166 crore. Company have not gone to any type of equity dilution since last 6 years (may be they were not able to find the takers but for now this is a positive point for me).\n Its liquid storage business possess moat. It has very high entry barriers like extensive experience in handling every class of liquid (classified as A B C type of liquids), to get land at port, heavy capital expenditure for new capacity and have to fight for the contract in front of ISO certified companies.\n Future demerger of both business will unlock huge value.\n Capacity utilization at Goa and Cochin is 80%. In coming quarters the new capacity added at JNPT will also come online.

Financial crunch might have made the management to overlook some small dues kept unpaid as has been pointed out by some members above.\nMany famous business groups like Reliance, Jaiprakash does not have good history. Reliance had opened so many companies operation of which became unsuccessful. Value of shares and money invested in those companies by small investors was eroded to 80-90%. Finally, only Reliance Industries came out successful and the promoters had to somehow merge all those companies in this big RELIANCE and get rid of legal procedures. But what about the loss incurred by the shareholders? People are forgetting past by looking the present and to the future. Similar case happens in all business.\nIn the present case whatever happened to Ganesh Benzoplast was due to nature’s fury and extreme bad luckt, where they have lost everything. If any default in financial matters have happened was purely on compulsion and not intentional of the management. Form that minus 100% condition (not having even a single penny net-worth of the earlier two businesses), the company has now came to a stand erect position in another high margin business. The new business of leasing out Liquid Petroleum Product Storage facility is showing good results. Hence, we may perhaps forgive the management, particularly the young generation (the son of the founder), who is showing his capability and skill in improving the business.

It helps to know your views and gives us confidence to know that you believe its a minor irritant. I hope too that this is just a temporary blip and not a speed-bump to expansion plans. My concern comes from the past trend of how the management typically moves lethargically at snails pace on execution. The Goa LPG storage plan for instance.\nThey floated the plan in 2012 and applied for environmental clearance in the same year. They got the approval in May 2014. Three years later, in 2017, they tried to obtain CRZ clearance on basis of the Environmental Clearance received in 2014. The Environmental Clearance approval received was valid only for 5 years, till May 2019. Haven’t been able to find documents showing the current status of the environmental approval. I hope it has not lapsed already, since that may mean another long wait for the approval, all over again.\nDelay in LPG project may be justified on financial grounds, as the company’s finances during 2012 to 2016 were in doldrums, and then onwards, it was under BIFR revival plan, so may not have had the liberty to allocate capex for that project. It also failed to attract any financial / strategic investor during this period, probably due to BIFR status or the fact that no investor would want to invest funds till businesses were not demerged / restructured to insulate them from loss making chemical business.\nDespite the situations, 8 years is a long time for a project to take off, especially if it carries a superior revenue realisation and profitability potential (as noted in a post detailing notes from AGM 2018, on this thread)\nLogically, management priority should be to fortify the business by adding high yielding assets. So I hope this expansion issue at JNPT does not turn into a long drawn wait due to inaction of the management, and that they move fast to fix it in quick time.','Nov 2, 2020 4:02 pm'),(2657,325,802,'','Apr 27, 2016 11:50 am'),(2658,325,802,'Company Information\n1 COMPANY NAME PPAP AUTOMOTIVE LIMITED\n(FORMERLY PRECISION PIPES AND PROFILES COMPANY LIMITED)\n2 CORPORATE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER L74899DL1995PLC073281\n3 DATE OF REGISTRATION October 18, 1995\n4 LISTING DATE January 11, 2008\n5 PLACE OF REGISTRATION Delhi\nShare Information\nS.NO.

Thank you and over to you, sir.\nAbhishek Jain: Thank you Ali. Ladies & gentlemen, a very good afternoon and welcome to\nthe conference call to discuss the financial performance of the third quarter\nof financial year 2016 of our company PPAP Automotive Limited. The\ncompany’s CFO Mr. Manish Dhariwal is also joining us in this call. To begin\nwith I will provide a brief background about our company. The company was\noriginally incorporated in 1978 for the manufacturing of customised extrusion\nproducts. The company commenced the Automotive Parts Business in 1985\nwith the start of production of Maruti Suzuki Cars in the Indian market. The\nfirm was converted into a public limited company in 2008. In April 2014, the\ncompany’s name changed from Precision Pipes & Profiles Company Limited\nto PPAP Automotive Limited to reflect the actual operations being done by\nthe company. PPAP is a leading manufacturer of automotive ceiling systems,\ninterior and exterior injection molded products. Our company’s state-of-theart\nmanufacturing facilities are located in Noida, Greater Noida, Chennai and\nPathredi. All the plants are TS 16949, ISO 14001 as well as OHSAS 18001\ncertified. We are working with three Japanese companies for our technology\nrequirements. The relationships with these companies are up to 25 years old.\nWe have also established a joint venture with our technology partner in 2012.\nAfter the establishment of this joint venture company, as a group PPAP can\ncater to the requirements of the entire automotive ceiling system for our\ncustomers. Today, the company manufactures over 500 different products for\nits customers and continuously targets towards Zero PPM in quality and\ndelivery performance for all its customers. Our company is led by Mr. Ajay\nKumar Jain who is the Chairman & Managing Director. He is currently serving\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nas the president of Toyota Kirloskar Suppliers’ Association. I am myself part of\nthe Executive Committee of Honda Suppliers Association. Our company’s\ntarget is always to be our customers’ no. 1 supplier. We strive to proactively\nmeet the customers’ expectations and are continuously evolving our products\nand services to meet their requirements. It is this strategy that has resulted\nin our leadership position in the respective product segments that we cater\nto. The company’s core competence is in automotive sealing system and\ninjection molded products. We maintain a leadership position in all the\nproducts that are made by us for our respective customers. The company\nprimarily services the passenger car segment and has also started supplying\nto the LCV segment. All the Japanese OEMs in India are our customers. Few\nEuropean as well as local makers are also being catered by us. We are\nexporting about 10% of our products through our customers to countries like\nEurope, Mexico and Japan and soon we will start supplying to countries like\nArgentina, Venezuela and South Africa. We are also capable of doing in-house\ndesigning, tool manufacturing as well as testing and validation. This\nintegrated capability gives us a very strong competitive advantage over our\ncompetitors as we are able to give our customers an integrated cost-effective\nsolution for their product requirement. We have a track record of superior\nperformance with all our customers. We have and we will continue to be\namongst the preferred suppliers for all our customers.\nNow I will take you through the financial performance of the third quarter of\nfinancial year 2016. For the third quarter ended December 31, PPAP recorded\na total income of Rs. 71.78 crores as against Rs. 71.46 crores in the same\nquarter last year. The other income reported for the current quarter is Rs.\n45.64 lakh. It is the investment subsidy received from Rajasthan Government\ntowards our new manufacturing facility in Pathredi, Rajasthan. This subsidy\nwill continue and it will be received by us for the next 7 years on a quarterly\nbasis. The EBITDA grew by 52% in Q3 and it was Rs. 12.07 crores compared to\nRs. 7.94 crores in Q3 FY2015. The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 16.82%\nin Q3 as compared to 11.11% in the previous year same quarter.\nConsequently profit after tax was at Rs. 3.51 crores in this quarter which was\nup by 49% as compared to Rs. 2.36 crores in Q3 FY15. For the quarter under\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nreview the sales have been stable compared to the previous year. The growth\nwhich was expected could not take place due to lower demand by the end\ncustomers. The improvement in operating margins is a reflection of the\ncompany’s continuous focus on improving operational efficiencies across\neach and every aspect of the company. We are continuing our development\nof parts for many new models which will be launched by our customers in the\nnext 2 to 3 years and are continuously discussing about new models\nthereafter. As I told you before we are continuing with our track record of\nsuperior performance with all our customers. Our parts are used in the latest\nblock buster models like Baleno and Kwid which were launched recently and\nalso in the new cars showcased in the recently concluded Auto-Expo like\nToyota Innova Crysta, Honda BRV, Tata ZICA as well as Maruti Suzuki Vitara\nBrezza. I will also briefly take you through the 9 months numbers for financial\nyear 2016. In the 9 months of this fiscal year total income was Rs. 225.69\ncrores as compared to Rs. 220.73 crores in the same period last year. EBITDA\ngrew by 35% in these nine months and it is at Rs. 39.01 crores as compared\nto Rs. 28.85 crores in the same period last year. The company’s EBITDA margin\nfor nine months stood at Rs. 17.28% compared to 13.07% in the same period\nlast year. The net profit was Rs. 11.04 crores which is up by 51% compared to\nRs. 7.29 crores net profit in the same period last year. As a result of the above\nthe EPS for 9 months has increased to Rs. 7.88 per share from Rs. 5.20 per\nshare. The debt equity ratio is also under control and we are in a comfortable\nsituation to effectively manage our exposures. As stated earlier we are not\nplanning to take any additional exposures in the current year and are planning\nto fund the capital expenditure from our internal resources. Overall, if you\nlook at the trend for the previous 3 years we have been improving on all\nparameters and are making our best efforts to sustain the improved\nperformance. Myself and Mr. Dhariwal will try out best to satisfy your queries\nwith clear answers. But before we open the floor to questions, I would like to\nrequest you to kindly visit our facilities and experience the hard work that is\nbeing done on the ground to achieve this performance. Ali, over to you for\nmanaging the questions.\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nModerator: Ladies and gentleman, we will now begin the question and answer session.\nWe will take the first question from the line of Saket Lohiya from Phillip\nCapital.\nSaket Lohiya: Just wanted to understand, first thing first on what basis your margins\ndepends? What exactly does it depend on because earlier you used to have\n20-25% margins then it declined for the last 2-3 years and then again it is up?\nSo could you please just let me understand what caused the same? So a\nperspective of yours on this.\nManish Dhariwal: If you observe the performance of the company over the last couple of years,\nyou will note that raw material cost has been a game changer. In fact, there\nwere times when it was under 50% and for the year ending March 2013 it was\n60%. Now, this is one key reason which will explain the way our profitability\nmargin has moved. After 2013 our raw material cost as a percentage to sales\nhas been consistently coming down and if you observe our quarterly numbers\nyou will note that it was say 54.2% in June 2015, it came down further to\n53.41% in September and in December it is 51.87%. So there has been a\nconsistent improvement in the raw material consumption of the company.\nNow the reasons are multifold. It is not just one reason that I can say that this\nis the one reason which has visibly brought down the cost like this. First of all,\nour raw material mix which in terms of the sourcing has changed\nconsiderably. We were primarily importing our raw materials and now\nsignificant part of raw material is locally sourced. So that is one reason. The\nsecond reason is that when our cost went up the way it was in 2013 we started\na very active working with our raw material suppliers as well as technology\nproviders to identify alternate materials. And that process which is a long\ndrawn process because the materials that we use are highly specialized in\nnature. So that process started getting results. And as our utilization of the\nalternate materials is increasing, our raw material cost has been coming\ndown. I must also recognize the fact that the product mix for the quarter has\na bearing on the raw material consumption and all these factors when\nconsolidated give the kind of numbers that you get. I will reiterate that we\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nmake close to 500 parts for more than 25 to 30 models for our car\nmanufacturers.\nSaket Lohiya: So if I just see, this is mainly regarding the product mix and the alternate raw\nmaterial that you used. Just to understand what is the basic raw material? Is\nit a mix of various other raw materials?\nManish Dhariwal: Amongst, the most important reasons which has brought the cost of raw\nmaterial down is also the work that is actually been put in at the shop floor.\nOur internal efficiencies have consistently been improved and it has shown\nresults in the rejection reduction, in the improved utilization of the raw\nmaterial, and so forth. Coming to the question that you raised about the basic\nraw material, the basis raw material that we use are polymers which are crude\ndriven. However, they are highly specialized in nature, given the lot of\nadditives etc., that go into them.\nSaket Lohiya: So you mean to say that the raw material prices are crude driven as well, if it\njust goes to a general assumption?\nManish Dhariwal: The general direction is yes, but the percentages are going to be extremely\ndifferent. The crude prices have come down from $100 to $30 and my raw\nmaterial cost has come down but not even close to that.\nSaket Lohiya: So that is what concerns me as well that why is it not so? I mean is it the\nnature of the product as well, or the nature of raw material as well that it does\nnot really matter what the crude prices are, you will be only having your raw\nmaterial cost in the tune of 50-55%, no matter what the crude prices are, is it\nso?\nManish Dhariwal: Yeah, broadly yes.\nSaket Lohiya: So we do not have a risk of crude prices going up or something like that?\nManish Dhariwal: Not really, not significantly.\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nSaket Lohiya: Just to understand, what can really affect your raw material cost going up?\nWhat can really lead to it? Or you think this is a sustainable raw material cost\npercentage as of now because that has really driven our profits down for the\nlast three years and now if it is coming back I just wanted to understand the\nsustainability of the same.\nManish Dhariwal: See, plus-minus 1-2% is possible but otherwise if you say that, you are going\nback to 60%, clearly no because we have addressed a lot of concerns. We have\naddressed the foreign exchange aspects because now that is the pass on, then\nwe have addressed localization, then the internal efficiencies that we have\nbeen able to achieve are totally sustainable. They are only incremental, in fact\nthere has been only increase. They will only be improved. So broadly I do not\nforesee the raw material cost changing significantly from the level that we\nhave achieved so far.\nSaket Lohiya: Sir any sort of big competitive advantage in a single line? May be what I mean\nto say is any sort of competitive advantage that a company has, or let us just\nsay that who are our competitors I am not able to find much on the\ncompetition side. Are there many or are you one of those which is called\noligopoly players, something more or 2-3 more or 4-5 concentrated players.\nIs it so the nature of the industry?\nManish Dhariwal: No, there are many competitors but most of them are all unlisted players. And\nwe do command a leadership position in all the product that we make.\nSaket Lohiya: Your market share on the overall segment sir?\nManish Dhariwal: Mostly with all our customers we are maintaining more than 90% market\nshare.\nSaket Lohiya: So you mean that for a particular supplier you are providing for the 90% of\nthe requirement, is it so?\nManish Dhariwal: Next for Maruti we are almost 90%. For Honda, Toyota and other customers\nwe are 100% now. So wherever we are present we are supplying the entire\nsealing system for all the cars.\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nSaket Lohiya: One more thing, if I just look on the quarterly numbers, what happens\nsometimes I see if the last December 2013, the margins were 22% and they\nsuddenly dropped to 14%. I have not seen the reason quite far but if you could\nprovide an insight, is it because of the raw material shield something or the\nother?\nManish Dhariwal: That was primarily because of Yen price change with respect to Rupee.\nSaket Lohiya: In December 2013 and March 2014, between that quarter.\nManish Dhariwal: Yeah, in that year. See basically we were importing a lot of material from\nJapan at that particular time. So because of this exchange rate movement our\nentire profitability went down.\nSaket Lohiya: No, no sir. Actually I did not want to understand on why it went down, I just\nwanted to understand why it went up on December 2013 because the\nmargins were 22%. So why all of a sudden it goes up and all of a sudden it\ngoes down?\nManish Dhariwal: You are talking about December 2013, is it?\nSaket Lohiya: Yeah, exactly.\nSaket Lohiya: See that is the only odd one quarter for the entire 8 or 10 quarters if I see.\nThe only quarter which is having more than 20% margins was December 2013.\nSo I just want to understand on that particular part.\nManish Dhariwal: I think you need to check your numbers again. There may be some sort of\nanomaly happening there.\nAbhishek Jain: Our revenue was 60.8 crores in 2013 December.\nSaket Lohiya: And expenses were roughly around Rs. 52.2 crores.\nManish Dhariwal: Rs. 52.1 crores, yeah.\nSaket Lohiya: So that goes to around Rs. 12-13 crores.\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nManish Dhariwal: Yeah, so EBITDA was 14.1% and not 22%.\nSaket Lohiya: How is it? On Rs. 60 crores of sales if Rs. 12 crores are operating profit.\nManish Dhariwal: No, no, not Rs. 12 crores, Rs. 8.62 crores of EBITDA.\nSaket Lohiya: May be it is showing some wrong calculation. I am sorry on that part.\nManish Dhariwal: No problem.\nSaket Lohiya: If that completes the answer on the raw material sustaining part how are you\nsupposed to increase the sales from here sir, or let us just say the capacity\npart and the expansion you might have done in the last one year?\nAbhishek Jain: See as I shared in my opening commentary, we are working very closely with\nall our customers. So all the new models that are coming with them, we are\ngetting involved right from the design state. Recently we concluded this Auto\nExpo. So then all this, the new Innova Crysta and Honda BRV and all those\nmodels, we are already present there with them.\nSaket Lohiya: No, that is very good because it shows manufacturers’ trust in you and one of\nmy friends have also commented on your products, so products are good, no\ndoubt. What I wanted to understand is if the overall sales are not increasing\nthen how do you think the new models are going to affect or not? If there is\nan e-model of this car, all of a sudden it will not help the overall market to\ngrow. It will only take share from somebody else. So how will the overall\nmarket be like?\nManish Dhariwal: It is a market’s phenomenon. We cannot actually do anything about it\nbecause we are not in the business of selling cars. So that is something which\nmarket has to do by themselves and we do not have any control over it. What\nwe have control over is to get associated with our customers and try to get\nmaximum order for all these cars from them. That is what we are doing now\nand that is what we have been doing in the past as well.\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nSaket Lohiya: I think your major sales breakup, it should be in the old models and the new\nmodels. Is it so that the old models might be major part of the sales and the\nnew models which are coming up they increased their own share or is it they\njust – what I mean to say is sir, if the new models are coming they are taking\nshare from the older model as well. So overall how is your share increasing?\nAre you going to export or from exports you are trying to increase your sales\nbecause if the sales are not improving from here, then how are you managing\nyour sales from here?\nManish Dhariwal: See, if I have understood your question correctly, my sale obviously is to the\nOEMs and then you have to understand their sales composition based on the\nexisting products and the new products that they have launched. You must\nhave observed that in the recent times the new models are getting good\ntraction that it is at the cost of the business for existing models. So that is\nsomething which isyeah it is a market phenomenon that is happening. What\nwe are doing is that in terms of our sales top-line, if you can see we are trying\nto get more parts from the customers like if earlier models are coming in we\nare pitching in for more parts, so we are getting those. To give you an\nexample, in fact, Mr. Jain also mentioned in the call that our parts are now\ngoing to South America as well as South Africa. Toyota is going to buy from us\nand selling there. So all those initiatives are in place.\nSaket Lohiya: So right now your sales mix in domestic and export terms is Rs. 71 crores, if I\njust bifurcate in domestic and exports how will that count be?\nAbhishek Jain: 10% is exports but not directly, all through our customers.\nManish Dhariwal: We sell to Honda, Toyota and Nissan who sell to their counterparts outside.\nSo the part that I make is used in a car that is being run in Japan or say in South\nAmerica but we are not directly exporting to South America. We are selling it\nto Toyota in India who are then in turn selling it out, not as a car but as a part\nitself.\nSaket Lohiya: So if I just go 2 years back, was the percentage same or it was zero exports\nand all domestic?\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nManish Dhariwal: No, it has been increasing. I mentioned Toyota as a new addition. So earlier\nNissan was not there. So obviously it is a new phenomenon and it is on the\nrise.\nSaket Lohiya: So do you have the numbers of exports 2 years back or last year or is it might\nbe in the annual report as well I think so.\nManish Dhariwal: See as I mentioned here that we are selling domestic only, but the parts are\ngoing abroad. See the parts are not going to the cars that are being made for\nIndia only.\nSaket Lohiya: Okay. So you sell it here only and it goes abroad. So is there any margin\ndifference in exports in domestic because that is an increasing phenomenon\nas you say. The sales are increasing on that part so is there any margin\ndifference as a percentage.\nAbhishek Jain: See I would tell you very clearly, we are supplying it to the local customer here\nin India. So if I am supplying to Nissan, he is comparing my cost with Nissan\nwith parts which are being used in Nissan India as well as Nissan Japan. So I\ncannot have a differential pricing with them that my export price is different\nand my local price is different. So it is a common same price depending upon\nthe difference in specification or their packing requirement. That is the only\ndifference otherwise margins and basic costing is all same. It cannot be\ndifferent.\nSaket Lohiya: Sir just last question on the capacity part. Just the basic capacity, how do you\ncalculate the capacity and the capacity utilization, if there is any because how\nam I supposed to know that what levels of utilization are you having?\nManish Dhariwal: Capacity calculation in the kind of work we do is not really possible. Each part\nis different and each part has a different sort of complexity. Our parts undergo\na number of processes. These can be different for different parts. A process\nof flocking is required for weatherstrip. This process is not needed for say,\nroof molding. In fact if you will visit our facilities you will get a better\nunderstanding of our business.\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nSaket Lohiya: I did an active visit because this is something which is in my area of concern.\nI will take it offline that part but actually just wanted to know that if the overall\nmarket does increase, what I am trying to say is that if the overall car market\ndoes increase will there be an incremental Capex or there is existing capacity\nthat would be able to serve the market. That is what I am trying to\nunderstand.\nAbhishek Jain: I think we are quite comfortable in our existing infrastructure to deal with the\nincrease in the market right now.\nSaket Lohiya: To what level, just say Rs. 400 crores means if there is an increase you could\nbe able to touch Rs. 400 crores without any need of incremental Capex, is that\nquite a good number? I am not trying to portray your revenue position; I am\njust trying to understand what could be the possible drivers. If I am trying to\nunderstand this company on the sales growth, I am not able to understand\nwhy this company could grow if the market is not growing. So where have I\ngone wrong? So I am just trying to understand on that part. I hope that is not\na big problem.\nManish Dhariwal: Well as we make about 500 different products, so some products are there in\nwhich we have got some capacities spare so we do not need to invest in new\ncapacities. But there are certain products wherein if the demand is increased\nthen we might need a Capex also. So it is a very dynamic situation that we\nneed to manage. But fundamentally what I can say is right now we do not\nneed to invest in any new capacities based on what we have in hand. But in\ncase some new models are coming up in future then we might need to review\nthat situation.\nModerator: We will take the next question from the line of Nikhil Deshpande from Axis\nBank.\nNikhil Deshpande: This was on your raw material cost as a percentage of sales. In bad times it\nhas gone up to almost 61-62% and in good times it is about 45%. We are\nsomewhere near the good times, so where do we see it moving now?\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nAbhishek Jain: I think we are in a very comfortable situation now because we see it moving\nplus-minus 2% based on the market situation or everything.\nNikhil Deshpande: Yeah, so 45% so may be just passing by. So somewhere around 50% would be\nwhere we would be comfortable. Is that true?\nManish Dhariwal: Somewhere around 52%.\nNikhil Deshpande: Okay. Sir the growth this time is quite low, you have stated earlier also. It is\nalmost a year flat on revenue front. But if you see Maruti had done quite well\nduring this quarter, double digit growth over there. Honda has been doing\npretty well and Toyota was somewhat slightly on the weaker side. So what\nhas caused this to be because Maruti being a large customer the revenue\nshould have been on a higher side or is that so that there is a portion of the\nraw material cost and that is why the revenues look flat?\nManish Dhariwal: Nikhil if you will look at our sales composition, Maruti gave us 43% in the year\n2015 and Honda gave us 39%. So for us Maruti and Honda are quite equal in\nterms of revenue it creates for us. Now while this year the Maruti sales grew\nalthough not great but there was a dent in the Honda business specifically in\nthe third quarter, ending December 2015. Now, because of that most of the\nincrease that we got from Maruti was kind of adjusted by the dent we had\nfrom Honda. So that is the reason why the sales have seen the kind of\nnumbers that they have.\nNikhil Deshpande: And so what is the outlook for your key customers? How do you see them\ngoing forward?\nManish Dhariwal: See it all depends on the market now. I mean everybody is focusing on\nbringing out excellent products and the pricing is also on the correct side now.\nBut since people do not have spare money in their hands they are not able to\nbuy cars. So as soon as this liquidity improves in everybody’s hand I think the\noverall market should get better.\nNikhil Deshpande: How is the share with Brezza?\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nManish Dhariwal: Share meaning?\nNikhil Deshpande: We are present on the Brezza platform you said, what kind of products would\nbe there?\nManish Dhariwal: We are present in both sealing system and injection products.\nNikhil Deshpande: And Baleno is also doing quite well, so there also we have a good thing.\nManish Dhariwal: That is right.\nModerator: We will take the next question from the line of Bhavesh Jain from Envision\nCapital.\nBhavesh Jain: Any update on new logos like Hyundai or Mahindra & Mahindra?\nManish Dhariwal: We are constantly after that, so I think next week our team is going to\nMahindra’s to represent for new business and Hyundai is still under process.\nBhavesh Jain: And sir any update on our JV, performance of our JV for that EPDM rubber for\n9 months?\nManish Dhariwal: See the business is progressing in the same fashion. The JV also services the\nsame market. So therefore there is not much change there. Anyways the next\nquarter, which is going to be the full year numbers, we will be consolidating\nthe numbers of the JV as well and the details will be available during that\nperiod.\nBhavesh Jain: Can you share the revenue mix between a sealing system and this injection\nmolding product for 9 months?\nManish Dhariwal: It is broadly equal.\nBhavesh Jain: Okay, 50-50. Any tooling revenue in these 9 months?\nManish Dhariwal: Hardly any.\nBhavesh Jain: And sir how much raw material we are importing?\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nFebruary 10, 2016\nPage 15 of 16\nManish Dhariwal: Raw material import percentage has been consistently coming down, in fact\nfrom over 60% it was about 27% last year and it is around that level at this\npoint of time.\nBhavesh Jain: 26%?\nManish Dhariwal: 25-26%, yes. It was 27% last year, FY15.\nBhavesh Jain: Any new product addition in these 9 months?\nAbhishek Jain: We started this business in Baleno and Kwid has also started.\nBhavesh Jain: I am talking about some injection molding products, any new product addition\nin that particular segment apart from what we are currently doing?\nManish Dhariwal: See that is a continuous process.\nBhavesh Jain: Anything we have added in these 9 months FY16?\nManish Dhariwal: Means?\nBhavesh Jain: New products which are doing production apart from what we were doing in\nFY15?\nManish Dhariwal: We started this bright type of outer belt for new projects, like earlier we were\ndoing it for Maruti, so last 9 months we have started for Toyota and Tata as\nwell.\nBhavesh Jain: And sir the revenue mix which we have given for the overall entity, the same\nholds true for injection molding products also from 43% Maruti and 39% from\nHonda, so that holds for sealing system?\nManish Dhariwal: It holds true for the whole. Now the injection molded parts we only do for\nHonda and Maruti because proximity to the customer is a key factor. Injection\nmolded parts are slightly bulky in nature and voluminous. So for all the\ncustomers we give automotive sealing parts. Injection parts we give only to\nHonda and Maruti.\nPPAP Automotive Limited\nBhavesh Jain: So any new client addition in that particular segment? We are looking for\naddition of new logos in that particular segment?\nManish Dhariwal: We are discussing with every customer for the opportunities but last 9\nmonths we have not been able to add anyone but we are getting new models\nfrom our existing customers.\nAbhishek Jain: And see for the existing parts, we are getting offers from new customers.\nBecause of high promoters holding, low Debt-Equity ratio, market leader in their products, increasing EBIDTA Margin along with strong fundamentals company is just available at just its BOOK VALUE , Which I think is highly undervalued compared to other auto ancillary stocks.\nThis is my first post and I request senior members to dig further and post their views.\nThanks,\nPRIYA RANJAN MAHTO\nDISCLOSURE:-- INVESTED RECENTLY','Apr 27, 2016 12:28 pm'),(2659,325,111,'Hi Priyaranjan,\nMy concerns with the company are:\nNo pricing power - Witnessed by fluctuating margins.\nOn the issue of yen depreciating due to abenomics and finding a substitute RM locally - I find the management was not proactive. They considered increasing operational efficiencies and sourcing locally only when their options ran out. A proactive management would have hedged the currency risk and improve margins consistently when their was room for it.\nNo growth plans - The management is clueless about their next lever for growth. They say it is market dependent because they are heavily dependent on the volume of sales. In the long term they will grow along with the automotive market but short term triggers are absent.\nCapacity and Capacity Utilization - The management is completely clueless about what their total annual production capacity is. This in turn leaves them clueless about utilization levels and hinders planning for future expansion. This further creates doubt in my mind about the competency of the management.\nMarket Share - The Management says they hold market dominance in their product field with 90 to 100 % market share. I have not researched this point yet but given the size of the auto industry (export and domestic) and the sub size of the sealing product and injection molding products I find it hard to believe that the market size for these products is only 300 odd crores (PPAP’s Revenue) which is what they imply by saying we hold 100% of market share.\nPS: I maybe wrong about this last point, maybe the company means something else when they talk about market share or I am interpreting it wrong.\nThe management has done a good job in the recent years in improving profit margins, but you need to ask yourself is this the peak profitability period due to crude oil lows.

The company has added Issuzu SML as its new client. Talks with Hyundai are still going on and will fructify soon. Hyundai is taking more time.\nApart from Passenger car manufacturers, the company also supplies to LCV players like to Ashok Leyland and Nissan JV, Tier 2 supplier to Bharat trucks. The company will also supply to Swaraj Mazda, Daimler trucks, Maruti 1 ton etc in LCV segment.\nExports will be around 10% of total sales. All these exports are indirect exports. The company was exporting to Nissan and Honda and now exports to Toyota will also start in FY’17.\nThe tooling revenue stood at Rs 4.94 crore in Mar’16 quarter as compared to Rs 24.96 crore in Mar’15. Excluding the tooling business, the revenue was almost flat on YoY basis for Mar’16 quarter. Lower raw material prices and lower volumes and delay from customers led to lower sales on a comparable basis on YoY basis.\nOn a full year basis, net sales grew by around 4% on a comparable basis to Rs 293 crore as compared to Rs 284 crore for FY’15 sales, excluding the tooling revenues.\nInvestment subsidy received from Rajasthan government is Rs 31 lakh in Mar’16 quarter and will be every quarter for the next 7 years.\nThe company will launch further new products and parts for new launches of the vendors. As per the management, FY’17 will be a very exciting year, as most of the vendors have planned face lifting of existing models and new launches. Further monsoon expectations, 7th Pay commission etc will result in higher spending power at the consumer end.\nEntire capital expenditure of around Rs 20 crore for FY’17 will be undertaken from internal accruals\nBook Value stands at Rs 150 per share as on Mar’16.\nManagement is confident of sustaining the current margins in FY’17 with higher sales and volumes going ahead. The main reason for margin improvements is lower raw material costs. Local sourcing against international purchase, alternate materials, lower exposure to international currency etc were other reasons.\nThe JV reported Rs 34 crore of sales and already broke even at cash level and, will be in profits at PAT level in FY’17.\nThe company is actively working for Hyundai and M&M for their passenger cars sealing products and molding requirements,\nThere are no plans for any acquisitions.

This figure includes Tool sales of Rs.7.81 crores in FY16 as compared to Rs.34.02 crores in FY15.\nThe EBITDA grew by 28% in FY16, at Rs.52.06 crores as compared to Rs.40.77 crores in FY15. The EBITDA margin is at 17.20% compared to 12.80% in FY15. The net profit was Rs.15.27 crores for the current year, up by 27% from Rs.12.03 crores last year.\nAs a result of the above, the EPS for the year has increased to Rs.10.91 from Rs.8.59 per share in the previous year.\nThe Board of Directors have reviewed the performance of the company on 19th May and have recommended a final dividend of Re.1/- per share.\nThe debt-equity ratio at 0.35 is also under control and we are in a comfortable position to effectively manage our exposures.\nIf you look at the trend for the previous three years, we have been improving on all parameters and are making our best efforts to sustain the improved performance.\nBrief us about your expansion plans and the road ahead?\nWe are constantly working towards expanding our product base and our customer portfolio. Our endeavour is to provide customers with a superior value added solution for their vehicles. Since inception, PPAPhas been manufacturing Plastic based Sealing Systems.\nRecently, we have set up a JV with our technology partners to expand into EPDM based Automotive sealing parts. We are also exploring new opportunities for our Injection business.\nWe are constantly interacting with our customers for new avenues where we can add value to them. We are also looking at expanding the target audience by examining opportunities in the Non Passenger Vehicle segment viz. LCV, Railways, etc.\n. While our existing plant is a finishing plant set up on leased premises, we are in the process of building a new plant in Chennai. The new plant at Chennai will be focusing on servicing the customers in the region.\nWe are also considering setting up a new plant in Gujarat. Suzuki, as you are aware is going full steam on its facilities in Gujarat. We have already secured land assets in this area and shall be setting up the plant as the requirement becomes evident.\nWe are also exploring to expand our existing customer and product base.\nWhat outlook do you see for the industry per se?\nIn 2015, passenger vehicle sales grew by 7.2%, to 2,789,678 units according to figures from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).\nLooking forward, we remain upbeat on the new vehicle sales outlook for 2016 and beyond. RBI and the World Bank have pegged India’s growth at 7.6% over FY17 bolstered by a positive performance from the key manufacturing and services sectors.\nDomestic demand for new and used vehicles is likely to remain strong due to good monsoon prospects, payout of the 7th Pay Commission and improvement in availability of affordable credit, resulting in rising real GDP per capita. This rise will surely result in a good spell for the Automotive Industry.\nMoreover, passenger car density remains extremely low in India at about 21 cars per 1,000 people, but will rise to 28.4 by 2020. (according to BMI Research)\nAll in all, we are quite positive about the growth outlook.\nWhat is your take on margins?\nWe achieved 17.2% EBITDA margin in FY16. This is a significant improvement over previous years. We have been improving on all parameters and are focused to sustain the improved performance.\nComment on your Capex plans?\nFor the current year (FY17), the capex is planned at about Rs. 35 Crores. This capex will focus on setting up of a new plant as well as improvement of capacities wherever required. A significant part of this capex will also be utilized to improve our technology so that we can become more competitive in the long run for our customers.\nYour sales target for 2020?\nWe have been working very closely with our customers and expect that we should be able to maintain our leadership position for the existing business.

There are two processes (technical) available with the company namely extrusion & injection. The company manufactures ~500 products in these two segments. The company also supplies primarily in passenger vehicle segment & also started to supply to commercial vehicle segment.\nThe ceiling systems can be made of either rubber or plastic/thermo plastics. The company specializes in plastic ceiling systems. The ceiling systems can be further categorized into two uses, primary & secondary. The primary systems can not be converted to plastic because rubber has better compression properties. The secondary systems can use plastics but whether to use rubber or plastic depends on design spec. All the Japanese & Korean OEMs use plastic systems already. Tata Motors also use plastic systems whereas European OEMs prefer rubber & it is hard to convince then to move over. Majority of revenue comes from ceiling systems & this is where expertise of the company lies. The company claims 70% MS in India & 90% MS for all the customers they supply to.\nInjection products are primarily used by Honda.\nDemonetization Impact - Month of Dec 2016 Numbers\nAutomobile sales (2/3 wheeler, passenger & commercial vehicles) declined by ~19% which is steepest decline in 16 years.\nPassenger vehicles did moderately well & declined only by 8% whereas 2-wheeler segment declined by 20%. All the decrements are in YoY perspective.\nOEM Scenario\nSince last few years, around 20% of the cars sold every year are new models & that remains an important parameter for growth.\nMaruti Suzuki reported good set of numbers & are targeting 10% growth (volume?) with Ignis launch. Toyota & Tata Motors outperformed due to new launches. Hyundai grew in line with industry growth rate.\nHonda motors recorded 19% de-growth and M&M recorded 8% de-growth.\nIt can also be noted that can aggregators are also pushing up sale of new cars & 100,000 cars have been sold to them (Quarter?).\nCustomer Updates\nMaruti Suzuki\nAround 45% revenue of PPAP comes from this OEM. The models for which we provide systems, we have 90%+ market share.\nThe company has business for models Baleno & new upcomig Swift model. The company also has business for Ignis model.\nBaleno & Swift production is slated to be Shifted to Gujarat from Manesar. The company would continue to have the business & will supply from existing plants. The company had bought land in Gujarat last year & a small facility will come up as & when business starts growing in Gujarat. The company mentioned that for new Swift model, company has ~1200-1300Rs. business per car.\nOthers\nHyundai remains a focus area for company. Some ceiling parts are being sampled on Hyundai i10 model & also working with one of their existing vendors. The company would be supplying parts to Fotuner model of Toyota. The company also added Suzuki Motorcycles as new customer in two wheeler segment. The company would be supplying injection molded parts to them.\nNumbers\nPart sales grew at 7% (YoY?) Dec 2016 quarter. The capacity utilization stands at 65-70%. The company has provided guidance of 50Cr capex through FY18 out of which 15cr is maintenance capex of repetitive nature due to old plants.\nThe company sees more opportunities for efficiency improvements & would continue to work on that.\nThanks,\nRupesh','Jan 31, 2017 10:38 pm'),(2673,325,805,'Thanks Rupesh,\nEven I have been following this story and it looks interesting on the financial performance, especially the operating cash flows.

It is a manufacturer of refrigeration systems, the kind used for cold storage. There are 4 product categories\nCold rooms – 65% of turnover\nCommercial refrigeration – 15% of turnover\nIndustrial refrigeration – 10% of turnover\nTransport refrigeration – 11% of turnover\nThe company has 2 plants one near Ahmedabad & 1 in Chennai. The purpose of issue was to backward integrate into manufacturing of coils for captive use as well as upgradation of manufacturing facilities. Current capacity utilization is only around 50% or so (varies as per vertical) and so there is not likely to be much capex in near future.\nMost attractive thing about the company is the macro picture for its industry. India is desperately short of storage facility for food, around 18% of food & vegetables go waste every year and the number is substantial for other food categories also.\nMost parts of India are under penetrated (see attached report for details) and even in states like UP which have adequate storage facilities they are largely used for a single product only (potatoes). There is a desperate need for more cold storage and this is a critical component of the framework required to ensure that farmers get better price for their products and do not get squeezed on account of perishability of their produce. While we have been talking of a need for more cold storage for a few years now, the improved rural road networks, better power connectivity and greater visibility of farmer distress (both from an economic and political standpoint), are enabling factors that may speed up the creation of more warehouses. Essentially we are looking at an industry that may have 15-20% growth visibility for the next decade.\nCompany has shown good growth over the last 4 years with improving margins, debt has historically been comfortable and post IPO there is zero net debt.\nIn attached concall the company has guided for 30-35% topline growth next 2-3 years, they seem confident of maintaining or increasing margins at current levels by focusing on the businesses other than cold rooms which have higher margins. Also they indicate lack of capital was holding back business expansion which is now not the case post IPO funds.\nOn flip side the business is quite competitive and there are numerous local as well as imported players, entry barriers are not very high though like everywhere else GST should help organized players.\nIn summary cold storage per se may not be a high margin or attractive business with long gestation periods et al but this company going by the apocryphal story is the guy who supplied picks and shovels during the gold rush and made more money than the actual miners. At 16 trailing PE given scale of operations it may look fairly priced but it is a business that has lot of near and medium term growth potential and no listed peers.

It is also foraying into overseas markets in a bid to grow faster. The Company has upgraded its manufacturing facility located in Ahmedabad and Chennai to cater to these new segments.\nAddressing ICE Make’s 10th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Ahmedabad Mr Chandrakant Patel, Chairman, and Managing Director told the shareholders about the concrete steps it is taking to strengthen marketing and sales addressing to these new segments and overseas markets. Its core team has identified several countries having good potential for growth like Nepal, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Uganda, and Ravanda of East Africa.\nMr Patel said, “Ice Make has a strong roadmap for the future growth including Company’s strong focus on key business verticals like Ammonia Refrigeration, Reefer Van, Food Segment, Exports and South India operations that will help the Company grow faster this financial year as well. In our Ammonia Refrigeration vertical we have bid for over Rs. 60 Crores of Projects and hoping to collect orders of about Rs. 20 Crores. Ice Make also has an Order book in hand for 3000MT Potatoes and Apples Cold Storage facility.”\nWhat is more, this year it is working on a plan to commence fabrication of vessels for storing and holding ammonia so as to cut down further on delivery period and offer best in class 100% Radiographed Receivers and Surge Drums to increase the efficiency.\nThe company is also working on R&D for launching new in-house products like Dry Containers in transport refrigeration segment and strategic talks are on with India’s big players in Refer vehicle business for our pan India expansions. We are also negotiating with various Airport Flight Kitchens for food serving and tapping new segment like Cash Van and Carry Van with reputed companies.\nMoreover, we believe India’s online retail market will grow multi-fold in the next 5-10 years. The Company is consciously making huge efforts in joining hands with new brands and leading online food companies which will help not only widen our competitive edge in the market but also build long term road for growth for our refrigeration and cold storage products\" Mr Patel added.\n“The domestic economic environment has been challenging. However our experienced team having seen many such cycles in the past has been quick to respond with the plans and strategies, which have proved to be fruitful in tackling the current economic environment. Interestingly our basket of products and services are placed in such a manner that they are largely insulated from weakness in the overall market. Cooling and refrigeration systems have become necessities of the modern life style and thanks to under penetration we have been able to grow at decent pace even in difficult environment” he said.\n“We are driven by innovation and over the last 26 plus years the team has worked wonderfully in defining our growth. Our growth over the last five years has been healthy at 26.5 % in terms of revenue, 35% in terms of EBIDTA. Out profits have grown even faster at 64% CAGR in the period mentioned. Our efforts to grow prudently now bring us to a critical juncture when we become eligible to migrate to main board of NSE in Dec.2019 and we are happy and confident about this move as early as possible.”\nMr Patel further added, “In order to be a globally competitive business ICE Make is also strongly focussing on employee empowerment. We have a strong team of about 500 committed employees many of whom place the Company’s interest above their own. We are consistently upgrading our human resources through various training programmes to enhance skills and nurture talents. Ice Make offered an ESOP Plan in 2018 to its employees and has received 100% acceptance from them. The vesting period for this initiative starts after March 2020.”\nWe are happy to be a key player in a cooling and refrigeration industry space that has become investment friendly and driving significant growth for all stakeholders.

Important note no revenue realised till date\n3.Formulations development )- Suven is also engaged in the development of formulations, an extension of its business model. The Company expects to develop and collaborate with a partner, out-license the product in exchange for royalties and revenues. The Company expects to focus on niche and small molecules (global sales about US$20 to 40 million), which are generally off the radar of most large pharmaceutical players. This is a superb annuity business from 2014 till 2028 their USFDA ANDA for Malathion lotion (Taro) is going to produce 2- 2.5 USD million ( ~ 11 INR Cr) annually. The management expects to file 3-4 ANDA with USFDA in next two years. This potentially can become USD $10 million (~45 INR Cr) annuity for future years\nManagement a My take management is extremely focussed and highly conservative (in terms of accounting), The CEO comes out openly on CNBC and says that investors get excited over filling of patents , they should not be as filing patents has no material impact to top/bottom line of the company. Guidance are conservative, they expense R&D instead of capitalising it. The Annual reports are quite informative on progress of the company. 2014 Annual report is a delight to read if anyone is interested to under the company in details. Management compensation is reasonable\nThough I have to say the companyas website needs to be uplifted it is very outdated.\nPossible risk a Mr Jasti is 65 and I donat see any succession planning put in place.\n**Size of business opportunity **( Straight from Annual Report 2014)\nBesides, the US$58 billion research spending by the top-50 global pharmaceutical companies represents a large market for companies like ours with annual revenues worth just H500 crore. Of the US$12 billion pre-clinical research market, only half a billion worth of projects are outsourced, a proportion that we feel will significantly increase. If anything, the pressure is on companies with established business models like ours to scale our presence and account for a larger share of the customeras wallet and widen our presence across a larger number of markets, therapeutic segments and customers.\nAlso read this 2011 ICRA report- http://1drv.ms/1r8CNZG 41,it highlights key drivers for CRAMS in pharmaceutical industry\nPatents expiry\nFalling R&D productivity\nFocus on generics\nCost pressure\nQuality of Earnings )- I have done last five years earnings quality analysis you can see details here - http://1drv.ms/1r8D1zV 100\nThey key thing that that has triggered my interest is companyas positive enterprising and defensive profits in 2014, a continuation in this box can create value for investors.\nValuation\nManagement has guided that CRAMS division will do sales of 450 Cr for FY15 (lower than FY14) and expects it to grow 20% annually for few years. Given managementas conservative guidance in past I tend to believe they can achieve it.\nLetas transport ourselves in year 2024 (Wish I could do in reality) with my assumptions\nCRAMS business had grown 20% for three years from FY15 on wards , 15% for next two years and 10% for next three years. We would end up with sales of INR 1643 crore in year 2024\nNCE Segment a In spite for 1 molecule in phase 2 and several others in IND phase no commercial success for company till 2024, hence no revenues from this division. Highly unlikely a Read this from 2014 Annual report - It would be relevant to indicate that one of the partnerships (NCE molecule development) for a similar programme in July 2013 between two global pharma companies generated US$150 million upfront for the molecule developer (Like Suven) for the Phase 2 programme.\nFormulations Development a The company was not able to file any new findings after initial two three years (Highly unlikely )as guided in annual report 2014 they have 4 ANDA USFDA filings. The annuity earnings are INR 44 crores\nWith INR 1687 Crore revenues and net profit margin of 18% ( in 2014 their margin was 28%) and management has indicated that CRAMS segment is a high margin business. The net profit would be around INR 304 crores . At 15 PE the market cap would be INR 4554 crore. This means if you buy company at current market cap of around ~INR 2000 crore. The CAGR profit is around 9.57% which is below par for a long term investor.\nBut as you would have seen expecting company to not to commercialize any R&D work for 18 years would be real surprise. If USD 30 million is added to bottom line for year 2024 this improves our CAGR return to 15% which is good and not great. Any continuation of growth CRAMS business , additional ANDA fillings and commercialization of molecules could mean huge upside for our returns\nAt CMP of INR 200 there is no steep margin of safety, the company has to deliver on promises to get block buster results for investors\nRisks\nAs highlighted earlier senior management continuity beyond Mr. Jasti is not visible\nIf debt is taken to fund R&D in future it will be detrimental to investors return, the company has not done so in past\nNo revenue from NCE division will result in sub optimal returns for investors in long run\nPositives\nConservative accounting they expense the entire R&D expense\nNo debt is taken for R&D\nCRAMS business likely to be have consistent growth translating into revenue visibility and liquidity\nP Value unlocking in NCE division can be a boon for investors, the management has done all right things till date.

The rates for these quantities were R&D rates and hence SLS made a killing. The revenue last year on account of this was Rs175 crs and the PAT from this alone was close to Rs 85 crores. The management has confirmed that this will not be repeated this year.\n2). To take SUVN 502 to Phase II trials will cost them $20 million(Rs 120 Crs) over the next two years. They also intend to take two more molecules to Phase I stage later this year. This will cost them another $4 million.(Rs 24 crores)\n3). They have capex lined up for the Vizag plant and existing de-bottlenecking at Rs 100 crores in the next 12 -18 months.\n4). This entails a spend of Rs 250 crs over the next two years which is a huge outlay. The management is looking to dilute equity to raise this money.\n5). The management has guided that there are no takers for SUVN 502 till it crosses phase II trials. So the chances of striking a deal with a larger company in the near future is very remote.\nThe PAT for FY 15 would be 80-90 crs and for FY 16 it would be around Rs 110 crs.\nTherefore at today’s market cap of Rs2200 crs, the FY 16 earnings are being discounted 20 times. This looks a little steep to me.\nThe management has been very open and have been guiding a de-growth in both the top and bottom line for the next two years.\nThe question really is ,that do the participants realise this or are they buying this stock in the general run up? Many of these participants will be disappointed when the Q2 results come out. There might be better entry points then. Q1 results were better than expected as there was a small spill over from the order from last year. This will not recur in Q2.\nThe real surprise in this stock could be if one of their molecules clicks. But that is a big if. The management expensing the R&D costs is very conservative but correct in my opinion. Had they been capitalizing this costs, then the bottom line would have looked much healthier and these numbers are not small. Around 50 - 60 crs per annum.

AT SUVEN, OVER THE LAST TWO-AND-A-HALF DECADES, WE CREATED A PIPELINE OF CAPABILITIES INSTEAD. \"\nPipeline leads to success and sustainability.\nSuven has invested in robust governance, expensing its large and growing research and development costs. The Company has followed a policy of writing off research and development in the year of incurrence; it has never borrowed to invest in research and development spending.\nBesides, four global innovator companies named Suven as a preferred supplier for their drug discovery and development programmes which, we hope, will result in more CRAMS projects coming our way across the mediumterm.\n65.7% The outsourcing of CRO discovery services industry was estimated at 52% of the global pharmaceutical and biotech industry in 2013, poised to grow to 65.7% by the end of 2015.\nOur company’s bottomline declined largely due to revenues from pre-launch supplies for three products declining from H175 crores in 2013-14 to H45 crores, a reality that had been anticipated and proactively articulated. This reality of a decline in profits brings me to a relevant point. Despite having grown the business every single year across the last five years, our business sustainability has been consistently questioned. We are perceived as a highrisk service-based business marked by volatile quarter on-quarter earnings because successful project completion may not necessarily translate into repeat orders if the project does not carry through at the innovator’s end.\nThe number of failed R&D attempts is rising while R&D capabilities remain finite, making it imperative to seek specialised partners. Decline in NCE approvals makes it imperative to outsource and build a research pipeline. Diseases are becoming increasingly multi-drug resistant. Global pharmaceutical sponsors have larger research outlays across a lower number of projects for which they seek specialised research partners\nThe section on “Risk Management” was thorough and a good example of Munger’s “Invert always Invert” mental model.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nDuring the year Suven’s thrust on innovative R&D in CNS\ntherapies continued with an R&D spend of Rs 5894 lakhs\naccounting to 11% on sales with an increase of 18% over the\nprevious year.','Jul 21, 2015 3:11 pm'),(2763,329,833,'Yes, thank you for summarizing the key points… again, from the risk management section, we can infer that the management has always been proactive in highlighting the key risks which would impact future revenues and EPS.\nBest is do a SIP throughout FY 2016','Jul 21, 2015 3:22 pm'),(2764,329,834,'crazymama:\nFor me, Suven is a fat-pitch.\nYou stole my words.

Some of them could be much closer to completing the P2 trials.

Hence figures for Cash Flow Statement and P&L Account of FY2020 are not comparable to the previous year.)\nGross Block at the beginning of the year was Rs.344 crore and addition during the year is Rs.109 crore, mainly Factory Buildings & Plant & Machinery. In addition, Capital WIP at the end of the year is Rs.102 crore. This is part of Rs.320 crore capex, of which Rs.210 crore has been spent and the rest will be spent this year.\nReport says they are building facilities in anticipation of business; they do not have the customers yet for them. The facility will commence operation this year.\nIntangible Assets are negligible, less than Rs.4 crore.\nRs.307.39 crore has been invested in Rising Pharma Inc. giving Suven a 25% stake. Rising is a Development and Distribution company. This investment is made through WOS Suven Pharma Inc., USA. Suven got Rs.48.21 crore as share of Profit from Rising Pharma.\nIn the concall, the management has said that this investment should be seen purely as financial investment and not a group or subsidiary company.\nA total of 11 ANDAs were filed in the year and 3 approvals received. Of the 11, 3 are their own, 6 are with their customer and 2 are New Animal Drug Applications with customers.\nSupply of commercial volumes to 1 formulation was on at the start of the year. During the year, they have started 2 more and intend to start 1 more by the end of FY21. Thus, total formulations for which commercial supplies would be on by 31-Mar-2021 would be 4. In addition, they are aiming to commercialise 2-3 more products in FY22. The two molecules have a potential of Rs.50 crore revenue each. Company has profit sharing agreements with marketing partners and when the products are sold, they get a share of the profit.\nBusiness from commercial supplies are uneven, since once an order is delivered, the next order will come only after 12-18 months. The existing batch needs to be distributed and sold to the end consumers first.\nThere is no API manufacture today but the report says they can manufacture if the customers want them to do.\nNet Debt has increased over the year. Rs.133.25 crore is owed to Suven Life Sciences @ 8 % interest.\nThere is an “Advance for CSR Expenses” current asset for Rs.2.10 crore. Not seen any such item before anywhere else before.\nRevenue break-up is as follows, but as explained earlier, the previous year’s figures are for part of the year; hence the numbers are not comparable:\nRs.2.74 crore was paid as interest on income tax. It looks like there was a delay in payment of income tax.\nAging of Receivables is given in the Balance Sheet\nThough overall debtors have come down, the quality has deteriorated. Not sure if this is a temporary phenomenon due to Covid related issues or something else. Elsewhere, the report says Debtors Turnover Ratio improved “due to changes in the contracts with the customers”.\nGeographical break up of revenues is as follows: (Once again, note that the YoY figures are not comparable)\nEurope is the primary contributor contributing 79 % of the revenues to the P&L, and not U.S. There is significant customer concentration risk to the revenues with nearly 40% coming from a single customer. I think this constitutes a big risk. (Any idea who this customer is?)\nA new Contingent Liability of Rs.6.07 crore has cropped up under the head “Restoration Fee and Delay Condonation Fee” for APIIC-JN Pharmacity, Parawada. Not clear what this is.\nBusiness Segment wise break up of revenues is as follows:\n\nSame caveat as before applies; previous year’s figures are not comparable YoY.\nRemuneration of Mr. Jasti is Rs.6.08 crore which includes a profit linked commission of Rs.2.11 crore. Other Directors do not get commission but only fees. CFO gets Rs.34 lacs and CS gets Rs.25 lacs. Overall KMP remuneration is low and well within limits.\nTotal number of employees is 942 and average increase in salary for the year was 10%. There are ESOPs.\nTotal R & D expenditure was Rs.14.13 crore which is 2% of the turnover. Entire expenditure is Revenue expenditure and capital expenditure is nil.\nOne of the Independent Director Mr. DG Prasad is also an Independent Director in Natco Pharma, a company in the same industry (though not a direct competitor). Generally this is avoided.\nSummary and Conclusion:\nOverall, no major negatives found. The report strikes a fine balance between optimism and caution. Company says with the current business in hand, they will be able to deliver a 10-15% growth in topline and 20% growth in bottom line during the year. But there will be an issue in getting new projects, since not much is happening at the moment in the space (I think this is with reference to Covid disruption as the reason). One major risk factor is customer concentration.\n(Disclosure: Invested)','Aug 29, 2020 1:38 pm'),(2784,329,416,'Chandragupta:\nlargest\nDon’t know their largest customer name but what I know is that it is a chemicals company and not a pharma customer.','Sep 12, 2020 8:14 pm'),(2785,329,502,'I recently presented in our VP Carolina meet, on Suven Pharma. attached is the presentation.

Its true that their CDMO operations are focused on NCE, it is NOT limited to CNS space. For example, all four of their commercial CRAMS molecules are in four different therapeutic areas Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetes, Depression and Women’s health. So they do work across therapies.\nThe reason for high margin was mentioned in Q4FY20 Conference Call 5 as pointed out by @SwarnashishC on Twitter.','Sep 16, 2020 1:08 pm'),(2787,329,2,'sujay85:\nThe reason for high margin was mentioned in Q4FY20 Conference Call as pointed out by @SwarnashishC on Twitter.\nThanks, just to add some context, I’d asked @SwarnashishC this question on twitter (His tweet was in response to my question). Forgot to add this info on the thread. Thanks for adding it, Sujay.\nIt looks like the margins have peaked out and it would be reasonable to expect them to come down a bit as more molecules move from clinical phases to commercial phases. However, the revenue stream would become more stickier so the expected variation in revenues would come down. It would be interesting to see where the margins settle at in a steady state scenario where a larger proportion of revenue comes from commercial side. My guess is it would be similar to Divi’s.','Sep 16, 2020 1:17 pm'),(2788,329,502,'Sorry for a long post and excuse me if it’s repetitive at points:\nSuven, as you guys will note, until today they are specialized in making Intermediates for Base commercial CRAMS, and specialty chemicals. Only recently they are getting into formulations.\nConsider the snapshot of their margins, which have been consistently above 40%+ as the mgmt has always talked about. Reproduced for quick reference here (from the data I collected for the presentation in our VP meet)These are the margins for the last 21+ quarters, manually compiled from their quarterly presentations.\nTo @bhambani’s point although they produce for 4 different therapeutic areas they are therapeutic agnostic. They specialize in CNS space (among the handful few in India) but they cater to other areas too.\nTheir margins in my opinion can be due to the area of CDMO which they cater too, which is in the NCE space, where the volumes can range from very small ( on the lower end of the clinical phase) to large (if they go commercial). I believe the mgmt. agrees to contracts/deals/partnership provided they are able to meet an internal benchmark, of say, a minimum of 40+ margins. (Mgmt. Strategy, which is margin accretive)\nLayer on top of this if you consider that since they do batch productions and not continuous productions like how the other players in the industry might manufacture, say, for supporting day in and day out-manufacturing of a particular API/formulation. Even for commercial if you see mgmt commentary on this topic, a client might ask for a molecule say for the Diabetes molecule, Suven manufactures them probably in 3 months and then the client does not come back for more until anywhere between 12-18months depending on the velocity of sale of the end product. so they already have the infrastructure ready, knowledge (chemistry skills) handy and the scientist and the talent too … so they can leverage this and thus add a lot to the EBITDA and PAT levels incrementally.\nBut we do have to take a look at this in a broader sense - as they might be a quarter here or there and can be lumpy based on the product mix… in one quarter they might have base and specchem to manufacture and in other specchem and commercial, etc…For eg., if I remember correctly if you look at the above image in Q2FY19, the revenues where low- in Q1 they had all the raw materials and thus they could just build and ship the product well before in the previous quarter-ended (Q1FY19) and thus Q2FY19 might have optically looked bad… so if we zoom out and see the yearly progression, they have consistently clocked 45%~ EBITDA margins ( note- Pre R&D EBITDA is to be used for monitoring margins in the CDMO biz before Demerger, as they used to expense all the R&D effort for the new molecule discovery like 502, 3010 etc, whereas after demerger, we can directly look at EBITDA for monitoring margins as the R&D is baked into the cost of doing operations )\nalso to @bhambani’s additional point - its not a standard plant/system with incremental volumes in which they can do cost optimization to increase the EBITDA margins incrementally.\nAnother noteworthy strategy in this space is, they build infra either based on industry trends (like the OEL Level 4 they have been building in Pashamylaram plant) (or) customer-specific requirements. only if they have the infra, they can go ask for better projects. Imagine if they have a scenario where they want a project but it needs OEL - so starting to build after the requirement comes in, getting it approved by the regulators, and then starting to work in that plant - is lost opportunity cost… but by building it ahead of time and being ready to bid/ask for projects - is an additional advantage where they can demand better margins. (they have the luxury of cash to invest in these type of CAPEX & being prepared)\nThese are a few points that come to my mind about why they continue to command premium margins.','Sep 17, 2020 9:28 pm'),(2789,329,801,'Media reports surface saying promoters planning to sell stake.\ncnbctv18.com 96\nExclusive: Suven Pharma kickstarts stake sale process; promoters open to exiting 96\nSuven Pharma has kickstarted the process for offering stakes to strategic investors, CNBC-TV18 learns from sources.

But I just hope is this not correct. Mr Jasti has such passion for his businesses (both Life Sciences and Pharma), and it would be very surprising if he was to sell out at this stage.\nHowever, If the report is correct, then it raises very interesting questions. Mr Jasti is already about 70 years, is the decision age / retirement related? (personally, I doubt that).\nThe other possibility (as mentioned in the article) is that the promoters plan to use that money to fund the Life Sciences business, which is fast running out of cash. With failure of SUVN-502, monetisation is definitely delayed, and they will need funding beyond the 12 months of funds that they currently have. SUVN-G3031 is still under trials and with Covid, the schedule is likely pushed further out. The options before them were to either bring in a a strategic investor to fund the continuing R&D or to take Suven Neurosciences to IPO in US.

On the other hand, its a well-known fact that Life Sciences business is a zero or hero business, and the odds of failure are very high.\nSo, despite all this, if this plan is real, that only means one thing - Mr Jasti has unshakeable faith in his molecule pipeline in Life Science business.

When the impending entry of Harvard educated Radhika Piramal into VIP as the MD became clear, Mr Jatia resigned as the MD. You can read more about it here. 40 and here 33.\nThis background is important as Mr Jatia since then took over Safari and has transformed its fortunes and now is a serious competitor to VIP taking away market share from it.

The impact of this is clear as the company turned CFO positive for the first time since 2014 compared to VIP which has always been positive.\nDetails about the overall luggage market can be found in the Safari investor presentation here 51\nSome relevant numbers are that the overall luggage market is 23% luggage & 77% bags. Both put together did 138 million units in 2016 with 32 million units of luggage. These 32 million units had a value of 91 billion or 9100 crores. Safaris market cap is about 800 crs & VIP is 3500 crores. So the opportunity size is large enough.\nA large part of this sector is unorganized & the unorganized sector constitutes about 70%-80% which kind of matches with the sectoral numbers put out by Safari in its presentation. VIP has a market share of about 50% & did 1300 cr of topline, meaning the organized market is 2600 crores which puts the total market size at 11000 crores ( assuming 70% unorganized ).

From my ground checks though, safari may not have top of the mind recall, but it certainly has aided recall. People remember the brand. The recall is the strongest in the 35 and above category though. Anyways all that doesnt really matter at this point , whatever little brand awareness it has its nowhere close to the brands of VIP & Samsonite.\nBut that’s not the thesis. The broad theme is the shift from unorganized to organized aided by GST. GST has put the brakes on the growth rate of the tax avoiding unorganized sector and that is the new normal now.\nSectors like Luggage that have a huge unorganized component are prime beneficiaries of this change. When the overall sector is growing at 15%, has a huge unorganized component & that unorganized component is growing at the lesser rate than the overall market it should create a bankable opportunity for the organized sector due to volume & value migration.\nIn addition, when the top 2 players in that organized space are growing at a rate that is lower than the organized market growth rate ( for reasons that i am still trying to understand) , the 3rd player gets to be the main beneficiary of that volume migration. And that volume/value migration is substantial as there is a multiplier effect.\nHere are some calculations\nI have made some assumptions based on the data that i have been able to gather.\nOverall luggage market growth rate = 15%\nUnorganized component = 70% ( average from various sources )\nGrowth rate of the Unorganized sector = 10%\nGrowth rate of VIP = 15% ( from the financial statements the 5y growth rate is 10% but lets assume 15%)\nGrowth Rate of Samsonite = 15% ( Same logic as above )\nMarket share if VIP in organized=50%\nMarket share of samsonite =45%\nGiven that the assumptions hold - the base growth for the organized market comes to 27% & if VIP+ Samsonite post a growth of 15% each ( which itself is optimistic ), the growth rate for Safari is a substantial 248%.\nEven if VIP & Samsonite grow at 25% the expected growth rate for Safari is a derived 58%.\nOf course it is unlikely that it will pan out exactly as envisioned in the calculations - however it does provide a rational basis to think about what may happen in the future\nThe calculation is - Safari calculations.xlsx 29 (10.4 KB)\nBest\nBheeshma','Sep 27, 2017 11:41 pm'),(2812,330,473,'http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/army-canteens-most-profitable-retail-chain-in-india-ahead-of-future-reliance-retail/articleshow/53730716.cms 20\nAnother piece of info given Safaris focus on CSD\nSome more insights into the working of CSD\nThe Economic Times – 16 Aug 17 13\nMilitary canteens can learn a lot from modern retailers: M Baladitya, CSD 13\n\"When they do a contract with Canteen Stores Department, they have to assure us in writing that they will not sell any product anywhere at a price lower than us.\"','Sep 28, 2017 10:50 am'),(2813,330,473,'Employees\nSome addn facts to chew upon from the VIP & Safari employee numbers in the AR\nNo of employees has grown by 55% in the last 3 years for Safari while for VIP it has grown by 8%.

Good line up of product offering with established differentiation within segment - Carlton, VIP and Aristocrat (in the order). Entry level segment has been cornered by Safari with some overlap with Aristocrat from VIP.\nBoth VIP and Safari finds that entry level segment is growing really well. There is shift from unorganized to organized. Unorganized is approx 2x of organized industry thereby good head room.\nVIP has created really remarkable franchise for itself right at the middle of pie. Lions share of market (>50%) and that too with decent profitability. Listening to concall gives an impression that they are fighting out really well with Safari on lower segment and Samsonite on upper.\ncoming to Safari, again very high growth for last couple of years. However, personally it appears that its little ‘pushed’ and not driven entirely by market ‘pull’. Margin profile, working capital needs , debtor days all of this is suggesting some heavy lifting going behind the growth.\nOther way to look at this is, there is room for decent margin expansion should management focus changes.\nMay be little outlandish exercise, they will have ~250Cr. incremental sales in 2 years (@20% annual sales growth rate) entailing a need of ~75-100 Crs. of working capital (at ~30% working capital/sales ratio and no capex assumption).

There were many local brands on display along with VIP and in some cases Safari as well. The local brands were way cheaper and outsold VIP and Safari by a considerable margin and dealers were also more interested in pushing them as margins were higher than those offered by VIP/Safari. The product range was also limited in case of organized players while the local brands had all kinds of colors shapes sizes etc.\nHowever, things are different during the marriage season and overseas travel where the brand comes into play. During the marriage season, the stocking pattern changes dramatically with Safari, VIP, Samsonite etc all in overdrive.\nSo the sense i got is that luggage selling for the known brands is a very focused and seasonal game where how you perform in that period determines your profitability metrics for the year. Since space is limited dealers have to be choosy and the co with does the max advertising gets preference and thats how VIP has managed to be as good as they are. During the marriage season even Dmart adds another shelf for luggage.\nThe unbranded luggage industry is always going to be significantly bigger than the branded plays as the price differential is 30-40% higher.\nNo branded play can compete with the mass of unbranded players so how they manage the working capital during the marriage and travel season is the main difference from the demand side.\nWith that context in mind, I have realized at the market size of the branded luggage players is not that big and significant investments in creating brand awareness and brand consciousness are required by Safari if it wants to grow the topline by another 500cr to reach 1000cr.

The company’s products include hard and soft luggage, backpacks and school bags. The company’s hard luggage manufacturing plant is located at Halol, Gujarat and soft luggage is sourced from mainly from China and India.\nIndustry Scenario\nLuggage industry in India has grown in higher double digit in the last 6-7 years. FY21 is likely to be a washout as its fortunes are linked to travel industry. Growth rate should come back to normal level post Covid.\nIt’s a oligopoly market with just 3 significant players. Though Safari is 3rd largest player (with less than 20% market share) and has presence only in economy segment, it has consistently gained market share post change in the promoter. Further market share gain and value migration from unorganised to organised (just ~25% market share) segment can help in achieving superior growth.\nManagement\nIn FY13, Mr Sudhir Jatia bought majority stake in the company. He successfully turned it around and made it fastest growing player in the luggage industry. Mr Jatia is industry veteran and Ex-MD of VIP\nHe is supported by a team of professionals, who are well qualified and have significant relevant experience. Nevertheless, the company seems to have significant dependence on Mr Jatia.\nBusiness\nWhile soft luggage is major revenue contributor for Safari, the company also has presence in Polycarbonate luggage, backpacks and school bags. The company has manufacturing plant for Polycarbonate luggage (capacity expanded in FY20) and soft luggage is majorly outsourced. Safari has significant dependence on China for soft luggage, though, it plans to reduce it going forward.\nSafari is the flagship brand of the company, which caters to economy segment. It also acquired Genius, Genie (school bags) and Magnum (mass segment) brands during 2016. Presence in e-commerce and modern retail is at satisfactory level with decent visibility.\nThe company has done significant increase in its distribution network over the years with customer touch points (~6000) across diverse channels like Hypermarkets, E-commerce, MBO, EBO, CSD, Institutional etc.\nFinancial Performance\nDuring FY15-FY20 period, net sales has grown 3.2x to Rs.681 crore, EBITDA margin has improved from ~5.8% in FY15 to ~10.6% in FY20 and EPS has multiplied from Rs.2.25 in FY15 to Rs.13.64 in FY20.\nLuggage industry has been badly impacted since March 2020 due to Covid and the company’s performance deteriorated significantly with 90% decline in revenue and operating loss during Q1FY21.\nRs. crore FY15 FY20 Growth (x) Q1FY20 Q1FY21 Growth %\nNet sales 215.93 685.87 3.18 204.04 20.12 -90%\nEBITDA 12.56 72.91 5.80 21.53 -17.90 PL\nEBITDA Margin % 5.8% 10.6% 10.6% -89.0%\nInterest 2.91 10.21 3.51 2.98 2.03 -32%\nDep 2.89 22.47 7.78 5.35 5.32 -1%\nPBT 6.76 40.22 5.95 13.21 -25.25 PL\nPAT 4.26 30.66 7.20 8.27 -19.33 PL\nDiluted EPS (Rs.) 2.25 13.71 6.09 3.69 -8.64 PL\nROE % 5.6% 13.3%\nROCE % 8.8% 16.5%\nD/E (x) 0.43 0.33\nDebtor Days 68 78\nInventory Days 101 85\nCurrent year would be challenging. However, survival during this period is not expected to be an issue. Post Covid, the company should be back to its growth path. No salary cut during the current year; shows strong confidence of the management that business will be back to normal.\nROE and ROCE of the company are at modest level due to relatively lower margins and working capital intensity, though improved significantly over the last few years.\nDuring FY15-FY20, cumulative operating cash flows were negative Rs.35 crore. Working capital, capex and acquisition of brands were funded mainly through equity dilution (raised around Rs.100 crore in FY15 and FY18). OCF (Rs.72 crore) turned positive during FY20. Debtor & inventory days have not seen manor change between FY15 and FY20 and negative cumulative OCF can be attributed to strong revenue growth. Nevertheless, market leader VIP’s working capital cycle and return ratios are much better and Safari needs to improve upon these to achieve growth without equity dilution or debt raising in future.\nAuditor of the company is decent (M/s Lodha & Co). There are no questionable related party transactions and salary of Mr Jatia was at a reasonable level of Rs.1 crore during FY20. When his daughter was employed as Sr Manager with the company, salary of Rs.13 lakh was paid to her during FY19 (looks reasonable).\nVIP vs Safari\nVIP has much larger distribution network, brand portfolio and scale. Also, VIP’s working capital cycle, profitability and return ratios are superior as compared to Safari.\nHowever, it is remarkable that Safari has been able to give strong challenge to VIP by continuously eating its market share despite limited resources. There has been continuous improvement in business as well as financial indicators since takeover by new promoter and growth has been much higher and consistent for Safari. Also, as compared to VIP, Safari appears cleaner in terms management actions and related party transactions.\nFY21 will be surely challenging for the luggage industry but long-term prospects appear striking. Market cap of Safari is just Rs.890 crore, which looks very attractive considering oligopoly industry with double digit CAGR potential for a long period (post FY21) and Safari’s track record of above industry growth rate. Apart from sales growth; any improvement in profitability, working capital and return ratios towards market leader VIP, can be icing on cake in future. While it is difficult to ascertain possible improvement on these parameters currently, management track record of rebuilding this company step by step, does raises hope from a long-term perspective.\nViews invited\nDisc: Invested.

PC is best suited for the application having highest impact resistance. While PP is flexible and lighest, it is most economical out of the three materials being discussed here. Raw material price is almost less than half of PC.

Safari improving gradually and have sufficient headroom, if pursued well.\nWell, What is the differentiation for such stark divergence in ROA/ROE profile? Is it margin, gearing or asset turn? Actually, its amplified by a function of decent margin gap and slight inventory efficiency.\nEfficiency: - Think this is the most important aspect to be evaluated well here.

Not a surprise, rational was explained during Q3’18 concall for VIP industries. Basically, they pile up inventory whenever they are at better bargain position with Chinies vendors.\nb. Safari on one hand is paying comparatively promptly to its vendors (possibly to extract best rates from vendors and thereby jack up sales/margins).\nc. On the other hand, looks like Safari has ~2.5 months DSO as compared to ~1.5 months for VIP. Again, extending favorable terms to channels thereby ‘pushing’ sales. as a result,\nI have been tracking both VIP and Safari for some time and have went through recent Annual reports, concall, presentation etc. My overall take at a very aggregate level:\nBe design or by default, there is very neat segmentation of market pie between three players. High end market which is ~35% of organized market is ruled by Samsonite/American Tourister. Mid range market is pre-dominant by VIP with ~50% market. Good line up of product offering with established differentiation within segment - Carlton, VIP and Aristocrat (in the order). Entry level segment has been cornered by Safari with some overlap with Aristocrat from VIP.\nBoth VIP and Safari finds that entry level segment is growing really well. There is shift from unorganized to organized. Unorganized is approx 2x of organized industry thereby good head room.\nVIP has created really remarkable franchise for itself right at the middle of pie. Lions share of market (>50%) and that too with decent profitability. Listening to concall gives an impression that they are fighting out really well with Safari on lower segment and Samsonite on upper.\ncoming to Safari, again very high growth for last couple of years. However, personally it appears that its little ‘pushed’ and not driven entirely by market ‘pull’. Margin profile, working capital needs , debtor days all of this is suggesting some heavy lifting going behind the growth.\nOther way to look at this is, there is room for decent margin expansion should management focus changes.\nMay be little outlandish exercise, they will have ~250Cr. incremental sales in 2 years (@20% annual sales growth rate) entailing a need of ~75-100 Crs. of working capital (at ~30% working capital/sales ratio and no capex assumption). With current EBIT standing thin at 6%-7% they will have to go for equity dilution again (have done that every year for past couple of years) instead of debt. This time it could be sizable dilution if covering for 2+ years needs (may be upto 5-10% at a broad range with some broad assumptions).\n@bheeshma - sorry to put you on spot.

We expect the company to successfully leverage both, the technical support and brand strength, to grow in India.\nShareholding\nShareholders have not been meaningfully diluted in the past year.\nCovid 19- Risks\n• Demand Issue: Customers may postpone their buy due to uncertainty in job and business environment. Customers willing to buy may not be able to purchase due to lockdown or restrictions in movement of goods and services\n• Financing Issue: Customers may not buy due to unavailability or increased scrutiny while buying via easy financing and credit options\n• Supply Chain: Movement of goods and exports may take a hit as ports and cargo are shut or restricted. Labor or workforce restricted movement may not allow the company to be fully operational\n• Closure of Public entertainment places and Industries: Temporary closure of public and entertainment places may impact the sales and services of HVAC systems. Future projects such as the expansion of malls, industries, and smart cities may be impacted in the short term\nCovid19- Opportunities\n• Export: Japan is giving incentives to Japanese companies for shifting out of China. Considering the GDC is fully operational leading to expanding the export business and targeting South Asian and EU countries\n• Strong Residential Demand: Considering the number of employees will start working from home, home appliances will be in demand. The demand may not be there immediately in the short term\n• Strong Research and Development Center: Strong backing by the parent company with sharing of technology may help the company to produce superior and sustainable products\n• Sustainable Products: George Oliver – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson Controls recently said that “More resilient or flexible building space will be required to adapt to changing capacity or utilization needs. Safer environments will be created through seamless combinations of occupant screening, tracing and credential management, and more sophisticated ventilation systems. Touchless or frictionless access, lighting, and temperature controls will be implemented to minimize cross-contamination and enhance the user experience. Remote monitoring and service delivery, including condition-based maintenance, will significantly increase. These types of solutions are being deployed in some of our marquee projects today, and the list of ideas and offerings continues to expand”. This may drive innovation and implementation of new products launched in shopping malls, theatres, etc.\nValuations\nProfit and Loss\n9m results for FY20\n• The total revenue generated from exports of Cooling products for comfort and commercial is approximately 3%.

The focus of the management will be in the Tier- 2, 3 & 4 cities with online sales for certain products like water purifiers to also be launched. The company generates 6% of its revenue from online sales.\nThe revenue generated from HVAC is approximately 52% and from the sale of the domestic air conditioner is approximately 42%. Inverter-based room-ACs comprised ~45% of room ACs and ~47% of Blue Star’s room-AC revenues\nInternational orders inflow and execution from Dubai and Qatar are seeing good traction with order visibility from SAARC and African countries in the Electro-Mech Projects and Packaged AC systems. The management stated that it is seeing good traction from hospitality and rail orders.\nShareholding\nPromoter holding is low and float is high which impacts share price volatility in the short run.\nValuations\nProfit & Loss\n9-month results of FY20\n• Blue Star dividend (2.09%) is higher than the bottom 25% of dividend payers in the Indian market (0.87%)\n• Blue Star is undervalued based on its PB Ratio (5.3x) compared to the Consumer Durables industry average (18.1x)\n• Blue Star is currently value on its PE Ratio (21.5x) compared to the Consumer Durables industry average (18.1x). Blue Star has 5-year median PE is 41.\n![image|629x293]\nBalance Sheet\n• The past five years have seen Blue Star’s margin expand, due to 32.64% in average net income growth surpassing 9.68% in average revenue growth, which suggests that the company has been able to convert a larger percentage of revenue into net income whilst the growth in their top line\n• Debt is well covered by operating cash flow (150.8%)\n• Interest payments on its debt are well covered by EBIT\nStrength\nBrand visibility and recall\nPresence in multi retailers and individual outlets\nReasonable pricing\nStrong sales and services\nWeakness\nComponents such as compressors, there was still a dependence on markets like China\nRevenue dependency on the hospitality industry and Govt of India Infra projects which may be impacted due to Covid-19\nThe company continues to face slowdown from real estate and infra space resulting in order inflow de-growth of ~20%\nLiquidity crunch (debt- INR 3.96b) and have plans to raise NCD’s to meet capital expenditure and other expenses. This has aggravated due to Covid-19 issues and weak demand outlook in the first half of FY21\nConclusion\nJohnson controls may increase their market share by having more pricing power and reach due to its non-dependence on importing spare parts. The cash-rich company may not be highly impacted as compared to its peers in the short term as demand outlook will be weak. The enhanced manufacturing capacity may help increase its exports to South East Asia, Middle East, Africa, and EU countries.\nThe company has always traded at high valuation compared to its peers and may do well in the near future considering the enhanced product mix, branding, increased manufacturing capacity, and increasing export business.\nDisclosure: Invested - 0.5% of the portfolio\nReferences\nhttps://www.tijorifinance.com/ 7\nhttps://www.screener.in/ 5\nway2wealth.com 62\n62\nRR030220206f2c5.pdf 62\n415.82 KB\nwww.bluestarindia.com 2\nhttps://buy.hitachiaircon.in/ 5','May 14, 2020 11:57 am'),(2880,331,73,'Good attempt if it first one.

Long term average has been only 60% and going forward also the conversion is going to be low.\nThe reasons for the same are-\nIts a low margin business (~6%) with high working capital requirement (~20% of sales).\nMarch to May is the primary season in which nearly 66% sales happen. So towards the end of March there is always a build up of working capital.\nSo assuming the business is looking to grow 10% in next year, there will be 10% increase in working capital towards the end of March compared to same period last year.\n10% increase in working capital is around 2% of sales (20%10%), which is like 33% of our Cash profits margins of ~6%. So cash conversion is limited to just 4% of sales ie. 60-65% profits gets converted to cashflows in the end of the year.\nFor example- Sales for a year is Rs100, Cash profits is Rs6 and Starting Working capital is Rs20. Next year business is looking to grow 10%. So increase in Working capital would be Rs2 (2010%) ie, Rs 22 working capital will be there towards the end of year.\nSo your cash conversion here is just Rs6 - Rs2 ie. Rs4, which is 66% of your Rs6 profits.\n(Note: this is not exact point-to-point math, but this is what is happening here over say a block of years)\nLower margins also makes risk of operating leverage high. Here the Gross margins are 35% and PBT margins are 6%. So remaining costs are around 30%. So even if costs increases by say 10%, ie. this 30% become 33%, half of the margin goes away and so does profits.\nIt is always little risky to bet on companies wherein the margins are very low and the costs between Gross profit and PBT are high.\n(Have not given any thoughts to the growth prospects of the company as the business economics did not looked interesting)','Jun 24, 2020 8:52 pm'),(2885,331,257,'I agree with some points made by you here regarding low margins and cash flow conversions.\nTraditionally white goods business is of low margins due to very high competition from marque brands in the market and air conditioners are no different.\nThe few points I would like to make are\nAC penetration in India is around 8-10%.\nThere is strong tailwind and runway for AC companies as India’s hot weather is here to stay due to various reasons. Penetration will go up as affordability increases.\nOver last 10 years the company is able to increase sales from 600r to 2200cr, with capex of 600cr. Going forward as the company achieves critical mass in terms of sales, the asset turns will improve further and more sales will be done from existing asset base.\nThe company has come out with VRF technology which gives it good competitive advantage.\nThis company cannot be valued on traditional PE multiple valuation models.

The poultry sector has been growing 8-10% annually over the past decade and at more than 15% over the past three years. ICRA estimates that the domestic broiler meat demand will grow at around 15-18%, while table egg demand is expected to grow at 5%-7% over the medium term. India ranks fourth in broiler meat production, producing 2.9 million metric tons (MMT) of broiler meat. The U.S. and China lead with annual production of 24.0 MMT and 12.3 MMT respectively, thereby providing large potential to grow. At the same time, India is ranked third in table egg production after the U.S. and China, with annual production of 57 billion eggs. Moreover, the annual per capita consumption of poultry meat in India is far below the recommended and global levels. This offers ample opportunity for the industry to grow. Moreover, the demand pull for the sector is strong owing to rising purchasing power of Indians, changing food habits and rapid urbanization.**\nThe vaccination market in the other than poultry segment is also vast, given that India boasts of the worldâs largest dairy herd.

Today IIL is the largest supplier of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine in the world. The company has not just limited itself to vaccines, but has also ventured into formulations business. “As already we are exhibiting monopoly in animal vaccine from the year 1999.

Going forward if one looks at their plans etc, they are making efforts to expand the product range, enter animal health area (which is the bigger segment for all the MNCs) and get more revenues from exports.

Is it an opportunity or loss ?\nHere is a text from 2007 AR\nThe poultry industry has now stabilised, which was earlier under stress due to the Bird Flu outbreak in February 2006. The industry growth rate is back in double digits, this time with a higher focus on hygiene and disease preventive measures. The use of poultry vaccines has gained lot of importance as a tool to prevent diseases.\nEven if you look at results in 2007, the revenues were flattish. Eventually these things are a temporary blip and the industry would rebound very fast after the disease is controlled. In fact, Poultries had a tough time in 2016 also. If you read AR and concall transcripts, management said that the year was the toughest in last 10-15 years and costs of operation for poultries were 20% below selling price. But the industry has recovered now.\ntkkreddy:\nWhy Nepal was considered for new plant ? Landlocked ? And this is export oriented product unit. Any African Country could be a better bet.\nNepal was selected because of Nigerian strain cant be manufactured in India. Geographical proximity to India and 10 year tax break may have played a role. Africa could have been an option but it may not be easy to go to a country that you are not so familiar with. That said, Hester is planning a green field plant in Africa, but it will come only they have clear visibility of utilization at Nepal.\nNepal doesnt have a large cattle population. So PPR spreading would not be a big risk. If it spreads, Hester opportunity size will only increase.\nPPR vaccines are also needed in countries other than Africa. South east asia, middle east etc. The opportunity of PPR is enormous and Hester with approvals in place shouldnt have problems getting the tenders. They probably have one of the lowest cost structures, and also good distribution network. So I dont see any reasons why they wouldnt grab some portion of the pie.\nThey are also working with non tender business, although volumes will be small.

There are Africa specific diseases which have not been addressed to and also there are no major plants in Africa that produce animal vaccines. There are few government plants and less than five private plants, so we think that having a plant in the continent addressing specific African issues would give us a lot of mileage.\nHow will the investment be done and how do you plan to fund this investment?\nWe are still trying to fix up the project size which means the whole planning would take around a month, month and a half time. The equity that we hope to do is for US$3 million and it would be financed directly from our internal accruals Hester India. And this equity would be 100% ours, we are not expecting to take anybody as an investor along with us in this plant in Africa.\nNow as you plan to manufacture animal vaccines and heath products in Tanzania do you think that the product will attract high margins more than 80% of required vaccines are currently imported into Africa?\nThe vaccines and health products that are being sold in the continent are at much higher prices than what they are sold internationally, so yes we would be able to have a higher realisation but our bigger strategy is to make the vaccines and health products available at international prices penetrate the markets. Rather than addressing a small market with a bigger margin we want to address a bigger market with the normal margins.

The company initially established 10 cancer centres with private funding. Currently, it operates 24 HCG facilities (18 cancer centres, two multi-speciality hospitals, three diagnostics and one-day care chemotherapy centre). HCG owns 1364 beds and a team of 200+ oncologists (FY17). Currently, Karnataka, Gujarat regions comprise ~75% of overall revenues. In 2013, the company entered the fertility segment by acquiring a 50.1% stake in BACC Healthcare, founded by Dr Kamini Rao, which operates seven fertility centres under the Milann brand in Bangalore. Cancer care, fertility segment accounted for 92%, 8% of FY17 revenues, respectively.\nUnique Business Model :- What I mostly like about this story is their unique scalable business model.\nHub & Spoke Model :- wherein it leverage the Bengaluru COE [Centre Of Excellence] hub for providing seamless cancer care across the comprehensive cancer care centre spoke.\nLocal tie up to set up new centre :- Focus on a single speciality and opening of newer centres on a partnership model with reputed doctors, typically leads to a breakeven of ~12-18 months for each HCG centre.\nAsset Light Model :- Cancer treatment requires multiple patient visits to centres. Its treatment tenure is generally longer than other major therapies. Over the years, the company has followed a strategy of tapping local oncologists to set up a cancer centre. Each cancer centre offers comprehensive cancer diagnosis and treatment services including radiation, medical oncology & surgical treatment. It follows a partnership model (with HCG holding majority stake). This also helps it achieve faster ramp up in newer centres. As per management, a new HCG centre requires | 45-60 crore of capex of which 45-60% account for equipment costs, which is leased by the vendor and is paid by the centre after three years of equipment purchase. Hence, upfront outgo is only | 15-20 crore to put up a HCG centre. Each centre typically has eight to nine doctors and two to three physicians. HCG plans to increase its cancer centres to 25 (from 18 in FY17).\nHCG also owns and operates two cyclotrons, which are used to produce nuclear medicine to cater to its own 13+ CT-PET scanners (FY17) as well as supplying the same to third party scanners. Going ahead, the management is keen on setting up new HCG and Milann centres in high growth markets and also, expand into Africa through its existing collaboration with CDC, UK. The management has guided for a capex of| 200 crore in FY18. Gross debt was at | 442 crore in FY17 of which vendor debt is | 196 crore.\nWith it’s focused single facility operation in high potential niche area than go for multi-speciality has caught my eye. HCG expect to post 23% revenue CAGR over FY17-20. Owing to strong therapy tailwind and EBITDA margin levers HCG is positioned for robust growth over next 3-4 year.\nStrong EBITDA growth over 25% is CAGR is very achievable aided by steady growth in Centre Of Excellence (Bengaluru), scale up in existing centres which got operational till FY16, and reducing loses from new centres which got operation in last two year.\nKey Risk :-\nSuccess of Business hinges on network expansion :- HCG’s business growth has been primarily driven by new centres and hospital setup through various partnership arrangements and acquisitions. It is expected that this will continue to be key driver for future growth.\nSubsidiaries financial performance :- Sum subsidiaries reported net loss this year. Going forward they may continue to drag and may not sustain profitability , which could materially and adversely impact business prospect.\nSpecialist physician could disassociate :- Success of this business will depend on HCG’s ability to attract and retain the leading specialist doctors.\nExpansion Plan :-\nHCG is following a cluster based growth model.\nKarnataka Cluster :- This is the most important cluster which account for 47% of revenue is having the COE and 55% of total capital has been employed here. Expansion plan will be muted here rather HCG will focus on operating leverage from this Cluster.\nWestern Cluster :- The next leg of expansion will be in this zone. 51% incremental capital will be employed between FY17-21. This cluster as of now accounts for 33% of total revenue. New CCC will come up in Borivali , South Mumbai, Nagpur and Baroda.\nExpand wings in Under Served area of Africa :- HCG believes it’s speciality healthcare model can be replicated in other under-served healthcare markets as well. It intends to establish a network of speciality cancer care in East Africa. It has enter into a definitive agreement with CDC and it will invest in the former subsidiary HCG Africa to setup a network of CCCs.\nGrowth Prospect :-\nFertility and emerging high growth area :- Fertility treatment is yet another emerging segment in India’s Healthcare Industry. The number of couples going for infertility treatment and evolution is likely to increase from 270K in 2015 to 650-700K annually in 2020. The number of IVF cycles performed in India is likely to increase from 100K in 2015 to 250K in 2020.\nDomestic Oncology Outlook :- The prevalence cancer in India is expected to increase from 3.9 mn in 2015 to an estimated 7.1mn people in 2020. Reported cancer incidents in India is expected to jump from 1.1mn in 2015 to 2.1mn in 2020.\nUnderserved Under consumed healthcare in India :- Total Healthcare expenditure in India was at $85bn in 2015 and registered a 13% CAGR from 2000-15, out of which 70-75% is in Hospital segment. While private expenditure jumped 12% the expense from Govt/Insurance jumped 14%. Going forward , assuming GDP growth rate of 8% over FY17-22, it is expected that growth momentum in healthcare expenditure to clock 13-15% cagr over same period and would reach $180bn.\n[Disclosure :- Invested 30% of my portfolio .

PAT in FY15 was 3.7cr on similar revenues. On the numbers front, looks like the company is going down. So, why the recommendation ??\nReasons for recommendation\nReason 1. Huge order from a top Indian Telecom company gives comfort to investors and sustainability to the numbers. I believe the company being referred to is BSNL. It’s a multi year 150cr + order , whereby the company will take over the customer onboarding , customer communication ( billing , sms ,email , etc ) and data monetization of the client base. Earlier, the long term survival of the company was always suspect. Now, with this order, the long term survival of the company is ensured.\nhttp://corporates.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/42CFB512_5843_4B08_8911_BCDF99F039E1_121948.pdf 83\nReason2 . Global agreement with one of the world’s largest telecom companies was signed last year. I suspect the company in question is Vodafone PLC. The agreement will open each of Vodafone’s 20 countries as a potential customer for them. As typical global agreements go, each country would not have to negotiate the pricing or test the product, once this agreement is signed.**\nhttp://corporates.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/Intense_Technologies_Ltd_160315.pdf 52\nReason 3. The company now gets customers directly. One of the concerns I had as an investor was that if the company has 70% market share in its category in India, why are revenues so low. This can be only if one of the following 2 situations occur\nPossibility 1 : The revenues are under reported. This is not possible as all B2B clientele are leading Indian corporates leaving no room for manipulation of billing.\nPossibility 2 : the product itself is not critical to the company. I believe that since the company provides mission critical solutions, this is not true.\nI am now aware that there is a 3rd possibility. Which is… that earlier the company was working as a subcontractor with system integrators such as Infy / wipro / tcs / techm ( http://in10stech.com/about-us/partners#partn 21 ) thus leading to substantial loss in revenue. Now the company has started bidding for winning contracts on its own steam. A testament to this is the 150cr contract which the company won directly.\nReason 4. Operating leverage to kick in. In a software product company, once the revenue crosses expenses, almost all the incremental money flows into the EBITDA. Which basically means that additional expenses need not be done to cater to incremental customers. To give an example, once microsoft spends all the money in developing windows, and after initial sales of windows covers the developmental cost, each license of windows sold anywhere in the world accrues to the MS bottomline. Similarly for Intense…I believe that once revenues cross 55cr , which is their FY16 expenses, all of the incremental revenue should translate into cash for the company.\nReason 5. International Operations to break even. See the results for FY16 http://corporates.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/5A15EE31_2E45_4B88_B1ED_D98169187D22_203446.pdf 29\nThe difference between the standalone and consol numbers is the international ops. From these results, it’s evident that international ops did income of 1.80cr and expenses of 10.40cr. The company has overseas offices in Singapore , Sharjah , UK , USA. Opening these offices is an investment that needed to be made. I think the company showed great self belief and foresight in taking its product global even as it waited for its Indian ops to become profitable. The strategy seems to be paying off with a whole lot of global clients signed up\n( http://in10stech.com/about-us/customers-and-partners#cupar 14 )\nThe big market for Intense is the US. The company’s efforts in the market seem to have paid off as they recently announced their first deal win in the USA. I believe that this will open the doors for them in the US.\nhttp://corporates.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/0DE4040D_CF23_43F8_A626_206AC377832C_112640.pdf 34\nReason 6. Q1 results giving leading indicators of turnaround.\nhttp://corporates.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/C866A16D_7470_4285_BA1A_D30C2EB917E3_181906.pdf 17\nWe can see a substantial jump in revenue and return to profitability in what is the weakest quarter for the company. Q1 (I hope) has set the tone for a great FY17, which can be a breakout year for the company. Last year the company did 45cr of revenue….if they are able to cross 80cr this year, investors will see very healthy operating cash flows.\nReason7. JIO. While the company has yet to make any formal announcement on this, their website clearly mentions Reliance Telecom as a customer.\nWhat JIO is going to do is accelerate the digitalization of the telecom space due to availability of data bandwidth . More online billing / self service portals / digital communication. In a nutshell , more work and hence more revenue for Intense.\nSo, I have given most of the triggers , I will also present the other side of the picture so that investors can make an informed judgment on this\nRisk 1 : receivables are high. For FY16, the revenue was @44cr and the receivables were @26 cr.\nMitigant : The bulk of the company’s sales comes in December and March, when contracts are released before budgets lapse. I believe these typically carry a 6 month payment term…hence the receivables. All are considered good as per the 2016 AR.\nRisk 2 : promoter holding is low. The promoters holding is only 18%. If we add some key employees , it may go up to 30%.\nMitigant : There is no mitigant for this. From a group of people which initially promoted this company, a few left , thus reducing the promoters holding. The current promoter has never sold shares . The promoters are first generation entrepreneurs with no external source from where to earn income and pump into the company. This is a fact that investors need to be comfortable with.\nRisk 3 : Company’s zero debt status may change. The company may use up its cash to invest in hardware and to provide bank guarantees for the large contracts it has got.\nMitigant : Cash is not being spend mindlessly but in areas which will immediately translate into revenues.\nRisk 4 : The promise is there…the potential is there…the numbers not there yet\nMitigant : Much like Rohit Sharma. There is promise ( a global product used by who’s who ), potential ( great client list / contracts ) , but the numbers are unpredictable till now. To become a Virat Kohli, the company will have to step up its game and provide stability and predictability to its revenue performance. That will lead to substantial rerating as investors derive comfort from more good quarters than bad ones.\nRisk 5 : It is a Hyderabad based company\nMitigant : Nothing can be done about that. Investors can derive comfort from the company’s debt free status , global client list , dominant market share.\nComfort about promoters intention can be derived from\nThey have spent the last 17 years nurturing and growing the company.

The stock came to my notice as my trigger for 52wk high stocks in screener. I started reading about it with lot of doubts and mistrust. As a thumb rule, I avoid companies from Hyderabad after many stocks which failed me. But when I read about this company it was trading in 50 range. The company is doing software products for telecom and insurance companies. The product is about having wow experience in whole CRM process . They are not competing with biggies like oracle, IBM, SAPetc. Infact they are using biggies platform for developing these software. They are not making any cloud or analytics software product. They use these technologies for their own product.\nAs mentioned in the website that they have JIO as customer, Mr. Mukesh ambani on his AGM speech mentioned about E-KYC . This company enables that part of customer on boarding. Telecom companies need solutions where they can get customer on board faster, have a seamless integration with their billing software, complain software etc. This company provides solution for this problem. The problem that happens is that if you have taken a SIM from airtel, again you want another SIM from airtel , you will endup giving same set of documents and photos. They avoid this. They have algorithm which avoids de-duplication. BSNL has taken their solution to speedup onboarding and meet regulatory requirement.\nThe business model followed is one time licensing, NRE+royalty model. They charge per user per transaction in some cases. They have got very capable sales guy from europe, who comes from Aricent and brought Vodafone as customer.\nI agree with your view on negatives of the stock. One FPIs has exited the stock. Stock is very volatile.\nThe next positive trigger on stock would be listing on NSE and adding CEO in promoter list. They have got COO designated, CEO and MD with good sales force. This should translate into growth.\nThe other positive trigger would be getting some banks as customer. They have focus on insurance and telecom.\nOther negative is company has tried hands with many products, they have software products for schools and trying to get into life science software too. They should avoid such steps and demerge entity and monetize the assets.\nIt is high risk business to be in software products in India. There are many startups doing same solution which are funded in millions dollor.

This is where it gets interesting:\nThere are three promoters listed in quarterly shareholding: C.K. Shastri, Uma Maheswari and Tikam Sujan. As of June 30th, 2016, Tikam Sujan’s relative Lalit Kumar Sujan holds 1% stake in Intense. Immediately after BSNL announcement, he exits. See screenshot below:\nWhile he exits, Marwadi Shares and Finance enters with approximately the same number of shares. These are the changes between June and Sep 2016.\nThe company has said revenues will be up ~65% (and therefore profits will increase exponentially), and yet the exit by the insider. The BSNL contract came to a standstill only on Feb 7th, 2017 as per the court ruling according to the company; Company is recording BSNL revenues starting July; Is it not strange that the promoter’s relative exits between July 2016-Sep 2016 immediately after the 150 crore BSNL contract is announced?\nTo continue: You should read my earlier post in this thread above on May 12 so that you can understand what I am saying next.\nLook at bulk deals between July – Sep 2016. Ashok Kumar Goenka and Ganpati Dealcom Pvt. Ltd. sell 1.4 lakh and 1.47 lakh shares.\nAshok Goenka is a Director in AKG Finvest and Ganpati Dealcom. I have already mentioned earlier that AKG Finvest and UNO Metals have a common set of directors, same mailing address in Kolkata and more importantly are insiders (they know insider information about the company before announcements are made to retailers/exchange).\nIs it not strange that insiders are exiting the stock as soon as the BSNL contract announcement is made?\nContinuing: Look at shareholding as of Sep 2016: AKG Finvest and UNO Metals own a substantial 10 lakh shares together. They completely exit between Oct 2016 and Dec 2016.\nAgain, the same question: Why are insiders so keen to dump shares when BSNL has contributed to 50% revenues between Oct 2016-Dec 2016? The BSNL contract is progressing extremely well, as per the company; there are no signs of standoff, yet insiders are heading towards the exit?\nFurther, the 21 country Vodafone contract was announced and yet insiders are leaving en-masse?\nI am going by what BSE discloses as a policy: that is, only shareholding above 1% and bulk deals above 0.5%. The Goenkas have 4 entities registered under their name and the same mailing address, but there could be many more as there are 300 plus corporate bodies who hold Intense shares. They have engaged in circular trading to prop up trading and delivery volume as explained before in my post on May 10.','Jul 20, 2018 12:06 pm'),(3031,334,890,'PART 7 : Complete Explanation Using a Simple Analogy\nNot all Valuepickr community members own Intense Technologies shares. My analysis has six parts and may be tedious to read and understand, especially if you do not follow this company.\nHere is a complete explanation using a simple analogy:\nImagine a scenario where you own shares of a manufacturing company.\n• The manufacturing company posts 42 crores in revenues in FY 2016\n• On June 28th, 2016, the company sends a notice to BSE that a large new factory has been constructed that can increase revenues by 65% (some estimates say 100%) and therefore profits are expected to increase exponentially\n• Between July-Sep 2016, company records 25% of revenues from the new factory and posts largest-ever EPS; Does not disclose this fact until much later\n• Between Oct – Dec 2016, company records 50% of revenues from the new factory and posts largest-ever sales; Does not disclose this fact until much later\n• Between July-Dec 2016, there is frenzied purchases of shares by retailers while insiders keep dumping shares on them.\n• On Feb 7th, 2017, there was a fire in the new factory and production came to a halt; company does not say anything\n• On Feb 9th, 2017, stock price hits a record high of 248\n• Insiders continue dumping shares and retailers keep buying\n• On March 9th, 2017, there is a conference call.\nThe promoter insists that revenues are being recorded from the new factory and everything is on track.\nShare price plummets to 170\n• Share price goes to 185 in the next week (by March 15th, 2017) as retailers still do not know that there was a fire in the new factory\n• Share price starts hitting weekly lows and touches 100 by the end of May 2017\n• There is a conference call on June 1st, 2017.\nPromoter says: “There was a fire in the new factory unfortunately (No BSE notice, no prior warning, no disclosure of revenues earned from the new factory) but we have a fantastic pipeline of new factories coming up”.\nShare price from 96 on June 1st zooms ahead to 140 on June 8th (Insiders dump and retailers buy)\n• Company posts the lowest ever sales and earnings between Apr – Jun 2017 in a very long time and reveals it on Sep 11, 2017. Share price drops from 100 on Sept 10th to 80 on Sep11th and recovers\n• There is a conference call on Sep 22nd, 2017\nPromoter says: “There is a pipeline of factories coming up that can contribute 80 crores in revenues” (note: Pipeline can triple FY 2016 revenues, according to promoter)\n• A few weeks later, promoter pledges shares on Nov 30th, 2017\n• Share price is stuck at 80 for 2 months and for no reason goes up to 125 on Dec 29th, 2017 and back to 70 a few weeks later (Insiders dump and retailers buy)\n• On 14th Feb 2018, company announces earnings and sends a notice to BSE saying “We had a fire on Feb 7th, 2017, in the new factory, as you already know. We, however, recorded revenues in Q2 and Q3 2016 from the new factory and it totals to 25% and 50% of these quarters’ revenues, and this needs to be written off, unfortunately”.\nThe entire stock price increase has occurred due to these revenues and it took a whopping ~ 18 months to disclose that revenues were not even earned\n• Based on data, there is a strong case that there was no fire in the factory on Feb 7th, 2017, because there was no factory in the first place\n• In March 2018, company sends a notice to BSE stating that the new factory is now up and running\n• It is July 2018 now (share price has touched an annual low price of 50), and we shareholders are waiting patiently for genuine revenues to be recorded from the new factory\nReplace the\n“manufacturing company” with “software product company”\n“new factory” with “BSNL Contract”\n“fire incident” with “Supreme Court ruling over Mobile number linkage with Aadhar number”\nand you get what has occurred here.','Jul 21, 2018 11:12 am'),(3032,334,892,'You said “There was no factory in the first place”. It is premature to state that the BSNL contract is bogus.\nYou have ignored or kept out below fact.\nAs per company: BSNL revenue was booked based on milestones that were were reached. Due to disputes, the payments were delayed. If not reversed, company would have had to pay taxes, and hence was the revenue reversed. Company has shared on concalls that this revenue is not lost, and may be realized once disputes are resolved.\nThat rationale makes sense. Time will tell, if they lied about it.\nIn such cases, where customer disputes and holds payments, receivables pile up, and there’s no clear point of time where you write it off. In this case, they reversed it, instead of writing the revenue off.\nThe way I see this…\nIs the business real - surely yes.\nIs BSNL contract real - not done scuttle-butt, but I’d say yes.\nIs mgmt capable of managing the business they have on hand - yes\nIs mgmt fraud - does not seem so. they may have said half-truths, in hope that things will work out. but does not seem to be defrauding everyone by design.\nare they engaged in insider trading - not sure, as i have not spent enough time understanding. will go through work that Shrihari and others have done.\ndiscl: i hold.','Jul 22, 2018 3:52 am'),(3033,334,555,'@Shrihari i would say business is real for sure bcz “rishi” had used their software ( as he written in thread) and saying that was really good and its not easy to develop anything like this.','Jul 22, 2018 8:08 am'),(3034,334,890,'@bullrun1988\nI think that the software product is a good one, as well.

This is because, the AMC revenues (which I consider real) will balance out consolidated expenses and we are now waiting for a nudge to get the P&L statement to a much better positive territory. This nudge can come from BSNL or any other contract and can result in a significantly better share price than what we have today. My opinion is that, the wait may be worth it.

It means a lot to me.\nI want to take this opportunity to summarize my thoughts and share a few specifics with fellow Valuepickr members / shareholders. You might wonder why I typed this 20-page word document out and put this up on this platform. Here is why:\nI have lost a good amount of money in this stock. It is frankly my mistake, and an expensive one, moreover. I followed conference calls / call transcripts blindly, without looking at any other details (like shareholding patterns, technicals etc.). I was busy with other activities, but that is no reasonable excuse though. I do not want to repeat this mistake or any other, as much as possible.There is a desire to learn from this experience and hence this analysis.\nI have immense respect for the hard work that has gone behind my investment. So, I want to know exactly where I went wrong. I have gone back and looked at every possible element for the sake of a thorough analysis.\na. I have equal amount of respect for a fellow forum member/fellow small retailer ‘s investment and I can relate to their conundrum when he/she has lost a sizable portion of his/her investment; and I want to share my learnings with all of you, with the hope that you get something out of it.\nI have read through many Valuepickr threads and what I have realized is this: Some members say a vehement “YES” to a stock and some others say a strong “NO”. No matter what we say, what binds us all and what is common amongst us is that, we put our best foot forward; that is to say, we always present an analytically rigorous, well thought-through and logically driven arguments. Therefore, I have no doubt in my mind that fellow members like thestocklady have put their best foot forward and presented a coherent and a logical case; and so have I. Please, let’s not hold any one responsible here, let’s stay united. Our investment decisions are our responsibility.\na. My analysis is unbiased as I have positives and negatives to share. My eventual decision to stick with the stock for some more time might sound contradictory and illogical to you. But it is not, in my mind. There are myriad data points and the synthesis of them has yielded this decision, and in no way do I want to bias anyone’s buy/hold/sell decision in any way, whatsoever.\nI sometimes wonder: “Why don’t shareholders realize that by putting their money in a stock, they have become part-owners of the company. Why don’t they know that the management has a responsibility towards this investment?”. I say this because, we do not join conference calls and ask questions.\na. For instance, have you not wondered: “What has happened to the 80-crore contract (200 crore with 40% conversion to be precise) pipeline promised on the call on Sep 22nd, 2017? It can’t appear and magically disappear after a few days, now can it? Can we not join conference calls and ask promoters what has happened to it? Please do join going forward and let’s get as much information that can help us and others and hold the management responsible for their commitments.\nI have used some amount of humor in my analysis. In an otherwise disappointment of a shareholding experience, why not use some humor, I thought. Hope you are not offended in any way. If you find mistakes in my point of views, do let me know.\nThe best outcome for all of us is this investment working out, it will benefit: shareholders, company and even the government . No other outcome is optimal.\nIf you have read this far, I must thank all of you for going through my elaborate analysis (Parts 1-7 mentioned above) and thoughts.

(market cap ~3500 Cr.) is a subsidiary of global parent HeidelbergCement Group, based out of Germany. The parent company is one of the leading players in the world (ranks no. 2 in cement), with presence in more than 60 countries.\nIt entered India in year 2006, in a 50:50 joint venture with Indorama cements. It also acquired majority stakes in other companies like Mysore cements and Cochin cements. By 2008, the company fully acquired Indorama cements and in 2009 merged its operations with Mysore cements. The resulting entity was renamed as Heidelberg Cement India Ltd (or HCIL).\nThe company underwent brownfield expansion which it completed in 2013-14, the capacity of the company increased to 5.4 Mtpa (from 3.07 Mtpa in 2009). By 2019, the plants were running at above 90% utilisation rate, so the company commissioned debottlenecking plans to further increase its existing capacity by march 2020. The present capacity now stands at 6.26 Mtpa (as against total India capacity of nearly 490 Mtpa)\nCompany has its operations in Damoh (M.P.), Ammasandra (Karnataka) and Jhansi (U.P.). Majority of the sales of the company (~95%) comes from Central India. Products of the company include PPC (Portland Pozzolana Cement) and PSC (Portland Slag Cement) and it markets them under the brand name mycem. The brand has a niche but decent market in Central India.\nCompany’s performance and Financials: (all data from screener.in)\nHere are the sales and profit charts of the company for the past 10 years (in Cr.)\nPlease note that the jump before 2015 and dip after that is because the company changed its accounting year in 2014. So FY15 included 15 months instead of 12 (from jan. 2014 to march 2015).\nA glance over the past 10 year performance, in aggregate, looks very ordinary. Sales have grown at cagr of 10.8%, while net profit at 5.5%. However, after the company finished its brownfield expansion in 2013, there has been a significant improvement in its performance. The same is reflected in past 5 years data- sales have grown at 12% cagr, while profits at 49.4%.\nOver the years, the company has resorted to various cost cutting measures and optimisation of its facilities. Some major ones are highlighted below-\nInstalled a waste heat recovery power plant at its Narsingh clinker unit in Damoh. This meets 37% of the power requirement at the plant.\nOptimised fuel mix- kilns that were designed to operate on coal were upgraded to burn petcoke as well.\nThe company installed an enormous 21 Km long overland conveyor belt system to transport limestone from its mines in Patheria (M.P.) to its clinker facility at Narsingh, Damoh. This not only helps in reducing transportation cost but also loading/unloading times.\nFor its Ammasandra unit (Karnataka), the company has entered into a 25 year solar power purchase agreement which will meet 50% power consumption of the plant.\nCement is a low value and high volume commodity and as such freight costs are significant. As per company’s annual report 2017-18, HCIL has one of the lowest freight cost in industry. This has been achieved by adopting a flexible and dynamic mix of rail-road deliveries. The company has also entered into some long term tariff agreement with Indian Railways (not aware about details).\nBecause of above several measures, the overall operating performance of the company has improved over the years. Operating margin has increased 1.5 times from 16% in 2015 to ~24% TTM and is clocking right up there with the big boys for the past few years (only Shree Cement significantly ahead). Roce also improved from 9% in 2015 to 25% in 2019.\nThe company achieved an inventory turnover of above 14 last year (highest in industry) and an asset turnover of 1.25. Ebitda/tonne efficiency as per last year’s annual report was Rs 987. While part of all of that may be due to higher utilisation levels of its existing capacities (above 90%) and lower base, improvement in these numbers along with operating margin does suggest the company’s brand has good growing visibility in the region.\nThis further gets reflected in the number of receivable days, which is ~5, and has been that way since 2015. Likewise working capital to sales is less than 5% and again most impressive in the industry. All these suggest excellent cash generating capabilities of the company, total cash flow from operations over the past 5 years is 3 times its total profits after tax for the same period.\nConsequently, the company has been able to reduce its debt considerably, and because of excess cash has also started paying dividends. Borrowings of the company reduced from Rs. 1299 Cr. in 2015 (D/E ratio= 1.51) to Rs 398 Cr. in sept. 2019 (D/E ratio=0.32).\nOutlook:\nIn the short to medium term, due to the present lockdown and migration of labours, cement demand is going to be affected severely as per many analysts’ reports. For example, Crisil expects fall in demand to be between 10-15% this year even in the best case scenario, In the worst case it can be upto 20-25% (link 5)\nFor the cement industry, quarter 4 and quarter 1(summer) are the strongest, and both of them have been impacted, while the monsoon quarter (which is upcoming) is weakest. The fall in prices of crude however may provide some relief if the govt. decides to pass some of its benefit to industry/retail as it will reduce the freight costs. A lot will however depend upon govt spending on construction related activities and the easy availability of home loans.\nIn the long term, as per this ibef report (link 5), cement demand is expected to grow at 1.2 times gdp growth.\nRisks and Concerns:\nCement is a cyclical commodity. As such demand, supply, margins etc. depends on a lot of factors that are often outside companys’ control.\ni). A cut in government’s spending on infrastructure, rise in home loans, general well being of the economy- all can affect demand.\nii). Major raw materials used are- Limestone, coke and petcoke (as fuel), flyash, slag, gypsum and water. Transportation costs are also significant and hence petrol/diesel prices also affect margins.\nIndustry is very competitive and fragmented. There are many small and large players and there is always a chance of oversupply. Besides, in case of an economic slowdown, growth can come only from snatching market share of other companies which is not easy as 70% of the market share belongs to large companies who already have good brand loyalty.\nHaving mining access to limestone reserves, especially near the plants, is perhaps the biggest competitive advantage. Though HCIL does have mining rights (in Patheria Mines, near Damoh, M.P.) but procuring new access to limestone reserves may pose a challenge when the company decides to move to newer geographies.\nThe parent group has other subsidiaries in India besides HCIL, like- Cochin Cements, Zuari Cements (considerable presence in South India). Thus the parent group has significant presence both in Central India(through HCIL) and South India. And taking capacities of all into account then it is already among top 10 biggest cement companies of India.\nFurther management has indicated they are open to inorganic expansion (acquiring other companies) in other parts of India. While any such move will definitely benefit the parent group, it remains to be seen how that will benefit HCIL. As from growth point of view, it will be a huge negative if the company is constrained to operate only in Central India.\nMiscellaneous:\nPermanent employee strength- 1231, temporary/contract basis- 2974 (as per last year’s annual report)\nPromoter holding- 69%, pledge- 0%\nNone of the members of key managerial personnel (KMP) hold any shares in the company.\nTotal Remuneration paid to directors and KMP (including commission, sitting fees etc.) - Rs 6.55 Cr (% of total profit- 3%, % of total employee expense- 5.28%).\nMany of the directors and upper management of HCIL also hold key positions in other Indian subsidiaries of the parent group (Zuari cements, Cochin cements).\nCurrent Market Cap- Rs 3580 Cr., P/E - 13.63, P/B- 2.9, EV/Ebitda- 6.1.\nDisc.- Invested (10% of portfolio) and as such views expressed above might be biased.','Apr 28, 2020 1:07 pm'),(3067,335,30,'Key to cement or other commodity based business is the LOW COST production and the AREA where it is operating .If you compare EBITA/ton across the pears one can very well understand the game .\nsep 18 Vs sep 19\nShree Cement 907 -> 1481 —>up 63%\nMycem — 1041 -> 1169 ----->up 14%\nShree cement I like the most in the cement sector .

HDPE bags, used to pack cement, are manufactured by labourintensive units, now faced with a labour issue. So far, none of the company’s vendors/contractors has expressed inability to fulfil contractual obligations besides some vendors requesting additional time to effect deliveries.\n Logistics: For FY20, the rail-road mix for the quarter was 54:46. /the current lead distance is ~368-370km. The company expects some constraints on availability of truck drivers, labour shortage at railway yards and delayed clearance of railway wagons. Its current level of dispatches are adequately met by trucks available in the market.\n Sales and demand: No clinker sales and 10 days sales lost (~100,000 to 125,000 tons) in March due to the lockdown brought overall volumes down 10% y/y to 1.09m tons. Many dealers are faced with a\nliquidity crunch and want to liquidate inventory before placing fresh orders. Cement demand may be sluggish due to labour shortages in urban areas. However, areas where government spending is good, will see better demand. The company is concentrating on increasing its share in the trade channel, with the trade-nontrade mix in FY20 at 85:15. Volumes of premium products increased to 13% of trade volumes, up 38% y/y.\n Finance: In FY20, the company repaid the first tranche of NCDs of 1.25bn. Management talked of repaying 1.25bn in FY21 and `1.2bn in FY22 from internal accruals.

According to data published by the Department of Industrial Policy and Planning, India’s defence industry had attracted ₹ 130,000 million in Foreign Direct Investment (“FDI”) in Fiscal 2015. The proposed 100% FDI with full technology transfer aims at addressing the need of capital investment and improved technology transfer. Ordnance factories (“OF”) and Defence Public Sector Undertakings (“DPSUs”) are engaged in the manufacturing of weapon systems for the armed forces. The private sector has been mainly involved in supplying raw material, semi-finished products, and components to DPSUs, OF, army base workshops, air force base repair depots, and navy dockyards.\nSome key features of the Indian defence industry include:\nFourth largest armed forces worldwide, in the 2017 Military Ranking by the Global Firepower list\nOne of the largest arms importer, accounting for 12.8% of global arms imports (between 2012 and 2016) Ranks fifth in the global military budget (2016)\nThe industry however, suffers from several legacy issues. Almost half of India’s military equipment is approaching obsolescence. Additionally, India overwhelmingly relies on imports for its defence equipment. Almost 70% of its defence requirements are imported.\nIndia’s military seems reluctant to procure weapons from Indian firms, citing low or no track record in defence manufacturing. Additionally, Indian firms have refused bidding for government tenders worth approximately ₹ 975,000 million since 2013, quoting unrealistic quality demands, opaque processes, and slow decision making.\nBy 2027 the government plans to achieve approximately 70% indigenization in defence purchase, and the government has taken steps by budgeting ₹ 915,800 million for defence capital expenditure in Fiscal 2018, which is 25% of the nation’s overall defence budget. To take this to the next level, India expects to export defence equipment worth ₹ 128,000 million by 2019 to countries such as Vietnam, Mauritius and the UAE.\nBetween 2015 and 2020, the defence cumulative spending is estimated to be ₹ 22,931,500 million, of which new armaments spending is estimated to be ₹ 8,630,500 million. Procurement of new equipment from domestic sources is estimated to increase between 2015 and 2030 from 44% to 55%. By Fiscal 2025-2030, the defence spending is estimated to hit ₹ 41,934,700 million.\nNew procurement policies would likely result in indigenous development and increased production in the long term. The Indian defence establishment will move from off-the-shelf purchases to co-development and partnership. Critical equipment shortfall in certain sectors would mandate high-value, off-the-shelf purchases in the short and medium terms to maintain the combat readiness of the Indian Armed Forces.\nContribution of the Defence Sector to the Indian Economy\nThere is a positive direct link between the defence budget growth and economic growth. Defence spending has macroeconomic implications, since security threats have an adverse impact on trade and business. Gross Capital Formation (“GCF”), (investment, at current prices) estimate for Fiscal 2016 was 30.4% of GDP, the lowest since Fiscal 2012. However, India stood well above the global average of 24.2% in 2015, which is a healthy sign. The way forward is to boost investments through increased private-public partnerships.\nDefence allocation is likely to remain constant for the next three to four years, in order for the government to focus on offsetting the economic impact of demonetization. The MoD currently need an increase of roughly 10% to deal with inflation and the vast sums required to modernize India’s aging military hardware.\nSpeciality material – high value speciality Steel, Superalloys and titanium alloy products – are a vital segment to the defence industry, and is found on almost every application platform. For instance, fighter jets use high performance specialty steels and Superalloys. Light armoured vehicles use significant tonnage of steel plate per vehicle. Steel plates are also used by the navy in the fleets of bodies and propulsion systems. The control cables found in the defence industry are produced from steel wire rope. A subsequent increase in the defence budget will have a direct positive impact on the demand of speciality material in India. Given the cost advantage and highly skilled engineering talent base, India could harness its potential to produce superior material indigenously and also increase its presence in the global supply chain.\nThe market growth for high value speciality steel, Super-alloy and titanium alloy products is largely dependent on new project investment and expansion plans of the defence, air force, navy, space segments. The Army’s plans involve indigenization of key components and spares of tanks and other weapons systems. This is in synchronization with the aim of the MoD to reduce import bill and promote domestic production of military equipment. The Indian Air Force (“IAF”) has outlined its 10-year modernization plan (2016-2026) that identifies services and technologies which it requires, and aims to share this information with the private sector. About 15% of the projected acquisitions of ₹ 30 lakh million are likely to be sourced from local manufacturers. Also, half of the Indian fighters are due to retire between 2015 and 2024. A government to government (“G2G”) contract for off-the-shelf purchases of 36 aircrafts is currently under negotiation. The remaining 90 fighters will be developed under Make in India. In its expansion plans, ISRO has announced various projects that will increase demand for specialty materials. For instance, Chandrayaan 2, GSLV MK-III, SAARC Satellite, GSAT-9, and Aditya L1 are some of ISRO’s upcoming space missions.\nEmphasis is laid on the indigenous design, development, and manufacture of cutting-edge weapons and missiles\nGlobal Industry Outlook :\nMarket Overview for High Value Speciality Steel\nHigh value speciality steels are premium alloy steel grades that are used across major industries such as automotive, industrial components, aerospace, defence, oil & gas etc., mainly as functional components that are subjected to high temperature, stress and corrosive environment. As per World’s Steel Association, the global finished steel consumption is estimated to be 1,515 million tonnes, of which commercial high value speciality steel products account to around 5% in 2016. High value speciality steel grades are broadly classified as Nickel alloy, armor grade steel and other speciality stainless steel grades.\nMarket Overview for Superalloys\nSuperalloys are speciality products that have superior resistance towards corrosion and oxidation at high temperature (around 600oC) with extended lifespan in higher stress conditions. Frost & Sullivan observed the global demand for superalloy products to be around 425,000 MT, with major consumption in countries such as US, Germany, France, Italy, UK, Russia and Spain.\nMarket Overview for Titanium Alloys\nTitanium metal is known for its high strength to low weight ratio, making it an ideal material for aircrafts manufacturing, including fighter aircrafts. Other key end user segments where titanium finds application are bio medical implants, and exhaust systems in high end automobiles. Frost & Sullivan observed global production of titanium to be around 200,000 MT in 2016, with China and USA leading in global production. Titanium alloys occupying a healthy 13% of total aerospace raw material demand through the year 2020 globally, will fuel the demand growth for titanium alloy products during the next five years.\nThe United States is the largest supplier of high value speciality Steel, superalloy and titanium alloy products in the global market. The US has high defence budgets and large internal demand for aerospace and defence products. Majority of the global suppliers of high value speciality steel, superalloy and titanium alloy are based in the US due to large end users being based out of the country. These suppliers also have strong export orders. Other key countries for the supply of selected products are UK, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Russia and China.\nMOU / Alliance:\nRecently Mishra Dhatu Nigam and TUBACEX, a multinational group with its headquarters in Alava, Spain and a global leader in the manufacture of stainless steel and high-alloyed tubular products signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to pursue a collaborative business model with the intention to develop and analyse potential joint business developments both for India and for other regions, based on their complementary manufacturing technologies for Power Generation and Oil & Gas applications.\nFundamentals\n\n\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nAs per CPSE Capital Restructuring Guidelines, all central public sector enterprises are required to pay a minimum annual dividend of 30 % of profit after tax or 5 % of the net-worth, whichever is higher, subject to the maximum dividend permitted under the extant legal provisions and the conditions mentioned in the aforesaid memorandum.\nFuture:\nMidhani seeks to enter the new markets of oil & gas, mining, power, railways, chemicals and fertilisers. The company is also positively looking at export opportunities.\nLast but not least but very important point is that main expense of the company is cost of conversation is power / fuel\nFuel is taken from government public sector undertaking through competitive pricing and power is taken from state utility department. To reduce the cost of power, Company has invested in gas based power plant known as Andhra Pradesh Gas Power Corporation Limited and 4MW solar power plant and has applied for open access systems for starting the power trading to reduce the overall cost.\nTo ensure the reliable supply, company have a dedicated high power electricity line from Telangana State Transmission Company for it’s manufacturing facilities. It has installed 132/11 KV power transformers and one 132 KV switch yard for it’s manufacturing unit. It is also installing a second transmission line for high reliability.\nHowever, for emergency, manufacturing facilities are also supported by four DG sets, one with a capacity 625 KV and three of capacities 500KV each, with the total aggregate capacity of 2,125 KV\nSource : RHPROSPECTUS ( https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebi_data/attachdocs/mar-2018/1521178415613.pdf 4) and Company website and news articles\nDisc: Not Invested Looking for lower valuations , I am not SEBI approved analyst .This is not any recommendation to buy or sell or hold\nRegards','Jan 8, 2020 3:44 pm'),(3074,336,30,'It has got recent order from Punjab police\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/midhani_midhani-receives-order-from-elite-punjab-activity-6614026531897384960-BQyU 35\nIn house journal\nhttp://midhani-india.in/WordPress-content/uploads/2020/01/Sankalp-2018-19-45%20years%20celebration.pdf 22','Jan 8, 2020 4:04 pm'),(3075,336,721,'Thank you @yourraj for the detailed opening post. I, too, have been reading about MIDHANI and came across these important points from the latest Annual Report & May’19 Concall-\nFY19 Annual Report Notes:\nR&D expenditure of 30cr in FY19- Substantive investments have been made in R&D, according to the management, to enhance the productivity and to be at par with the global technological progress.\nExports of 8.05cr in FY19. Target of 40cr in FY20\nOrders booked during the year- 1844cr. The composition of which is- Space- 1280cr, Defence- 184cr, Energy- 314cr, & Others- 65cr.\nOutstanding order book at the end of FY19- 1660cr.\nThe important point to note is, and as mentioned in the first post too, that MIDHANI collaborates with its customers and its customers take part in the product development process. The result of which is that 90% of the orders are on nomination basis; only about 176cr of the total 1844cr orders booked during the year were through open competition. Since MIDHANI operates in a very niche segment and has little domestic competition, going ahead, this number becomes important to keep a track of.\nCost minimization efforts- We have successfully indigenized various grades of steels and also indigenously developed Automatic Billet Grinder, Mobile Grinder and LPG fired Furnaces. These initiatives have helped prevent outflow of foreign exchange. By using alternate input materials (i.e. scrap, plant reverts) MIDHANI could substitute ₹ 27.62 Cr. of imported raw material\nAwarded two patents for the first time-\none for manufacturing “Fine grained Cobalt based alloy” and another for an invention entitled “Newly designed Air Hardening Alloy Steel”.\nThe company’s focus on Technology & R&D is highlighted by two key points in the AR:\nMIDHANI signed MoU with M/s TUBACEX, a multinational group with headquarters in Alava, Spain on 17th January, 2019. The MoU would allow joint development of advanced materials\na dedicated team has been constituted to develop roadmap for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for alloy development and process optimization in your company.\nMarket for existing product basket:\nHIGH VALUE SPECIALITY STEEL - Addressable market for MIDHANI is ~0.4 to 0.5 Lakh tons, coming from Defence, Power and Niche Engineering sectors.\nTITANIUM ALLOY PRODUCTS- Titanium demand is dominated by Defence in India. The Titanium market size in India for FY18 is 3098 TPA and is expected to increase to 5231 TPA in the FY 25. MIDHANI is the only Titanium Alloy manufacturer in India.\nSuper Alloy- MIDHANI is one of the few players in India, rest all is imported. MIDHANI only has 1% of the existing market share.\nRisk-\nRM is volatile. Technology is constantly changing\nCurrently, majority of MIDHANI’s business (4/5th of volumes) comes from High performance steel. Going forward, this market segment is expected to witness high competition from private companies with similar/substitute products.\nLack of additional primary melting facilities like Vacuum Induction Melting Furnace, Vacuum Arc Melting Furnace and compacting press may prove to be bottleneck in the long run.\nHigh debtor days- High accumulation of Debtors is primarily on account of higher sales in the fourth quarter and the budgets getting exhausted at customers’ end, which are primarily Government Departments / agencies.\nQ4FY19 Concall Notes\nDisc- I couldn’t find the transcript and might have misheard certain things.\nThe management indicated that for the first time they executed such a large percent of the existing order book. The lead time of order delivery which was around 3 years before has come down to 6-14 months now. Some orders get executed within 6 months also.\nThe company started FY18 & FY19 with a very low order book of 532cr and 539cr, respectively. Yet, FY18 revenue was 662cr & FY19 revenue was 711cr. They are starting FY20 order book with 1660cr and are confident to touch 850cr in FY20.\nMIDHANI is a Tier-3 supplier. They supply to components manufacturers of ISRO, DRDO, and other agencies.\nRM situation- RM is booked on Fixed Price Contract (FPC). He mentioned that they have FPC for almost all RM required for existing order book\nRM prices were high in the first 9-months of FY19. They started softening starting Jan’19.\nVery little dependence on China & no dependence on Rare Earth materials\nNo dependency on one particular country\nWhenever order is received, RM is booked immediately\nGenerally, forex does not have significant impact of RM pricing\nInventory rose sharply at the end of FY19 because orders worth100cr were not dispatched as clearances from customers were not received. Rest is RM stockpile.\nMajor Customer- ISRO\nISRO’s employees work with MIDHANI & know their entire processes & capabilities. Working for over 4 decades with ISRO now\nPrevious orders are set as benchmark for pricing\nNegotiation does happen. ISRO mostly knows their cost structure.\nISRO has ambitious programs lined up.

They weren’t aggressive in this area as they did not have the marketing capabilities and expertise.\nTheir products are being used by prominent hospitals, like Cancer Institute, Chennai, Apollo Hospital, Hyd, Kamineni Hospital, Hyd, Osmania General Hospital, Hyd, Gandhi Hospital, Hyd, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, BIRRD Hospital, Tirupati, etc.\nThey have developed, manufactured and commercialized about 135 types of implants in more than 1060 variants.\nDespite having such a large number of products in its line-up, the company’s sales in this segment did not cross even Rs 1 crore mark.\nBut with this agreement, we are hopeful of increasing bio-implant sales to Rs 5 crore in the first year of agreement. Our target is to take this number to Rs 100 crore in five years.\nConclusion- MIDHANI is present in a very niche segment and has a long history with its customers, the major one being ISRO. There is a huge customer concentration risk. It’s revenues are dependent on the projects undertaken by the Space, Defence & Aerospace organisations in India. The company’s order book is robust and is mainly on nomination basis. The company’s efforts to diversify this risk can be seen by the multiple projects coming up by FY22 but there is no clarity on the kind of revenues these capex will bring in. Therefore, fixed asset turns could go down going ahead. The most interesting point to be noted is that a large capex of 500cr is being funded by DRDO and Ordnance Factory Board. MIDHANI is trying to grow its export revenues, too. Key risks to monitor will be debtor days going ahead, RM prices of cobalt and nickle, and new orders coming in from organisations other than ISRO.\nDisc: Tracking, not invested.','Jan 9, 2020 12:19 pm'),(3076,336,721,'Resignation of Sanjeev Singhal, the CFO of the company came in on 7/01/2020.

These products are used in various industries viz. ink, paper, paints, food, fabrics, etc.\nCompany’s clientele comprises global giants like DIC (Japan), Sun Chemicals (USA), Clariant Chemical India Ltd. and BASF (Korea).\nAlthough one shouldn’t rely on this, but, one notable observation is that (source FY13-14 AR) : 76% of the Company’s revenues were derived from customers who have been working with the company for more than five years.\nCompany website 8\nFinancial Summary:\nCurrent Market Cap: Rs. 177.5 crore\nCMP: Rs. 140\nBook Value Per Share: Rs. 120\nFY 14-15 Sales Turnover: Rs. 258 crore\nFY 14-15 EBITDA: Rs. 38 crore\nFY 14-15 Net Profit: Rs. 17.72 crore\nDebt Equity Ratio: 0.5\nP/E: Around 10x\nOther financials can be found here 11\nSales CAGR 10 Yrs: 24.62%\nProfit CAGR 10 Yrs: 34.00%\nFinancial figures for FY 12-13 is dismal, as the company went into upgradation of its plant. Below is the answer for the same given by the management in its AR.\n“Over the 12 months leading towards the close of 2012-13, the Company invested Rs. 29.70 crore in capital expenditure, of which a sizeable Rs. 13.93 crore was deployed in environment treatment assets and infrastructure. The usual capex in capacity over the years had been productive, enabling the Company to generate an increase in throughput that translated into enhanced revenues and profits. However, the sizeable investment in environment protecting assets did not generate any increase in revenues (though this is expected to generate repeat and growing business over the foreseeable future), which reduced the Company’s cushion against probable cost increases or price declines.”\nDuring the above mentioned period, there were instances where other companies into similar industry were forced to shut down their plants as they weren’t emission compliant as per GPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board).\nIn the following year, which is FY 13-14, the company bounced back with clocking turnover of Rs. 302 crore and NP of Rs. 14.59 crore. However, the EBITDA margin stood at 12.81%, which is lower than their past EBITDA margins (of 15-19%). I could not find the reason for the same. Company raised debt in the same year to install/upgrade water treatment plant.\nAlso, in FY 14-15, their sales have decreased from Rs. 302 cr in previous year to Rs. 258 cr. Eagerly awaiting latest AR to ascertain the reason for the same.\nManagement Quality:\nNo red flags observed as of now. Need to dig further.\nKey Observations:\nCompany enjoys good EBITDA margins despite being in a commodity type business. This may be due to less competition in similar grade (quality) of pigments they manufacture.\nHave consistently increased sales and profit margins. (except as discussed above)\nDecent return ratios\nAvailable at decent valuations when compared to past growth. (Only if growth is observed in long term)\nKey Points To Be Worked Upon:\nNeed to ascertain what impact can raw materials have on its products. Crude Oil or its derivatives are their prime raw material.\nCompany’s bargaining power - buyer and supplier.\nTo analyse operational performance of the company - Asset Turnover, Inventory Turnover, etc.\nCash flow analysis - Net Profit to Free Cash Flow, etc.\nCapacity utilization / Capacity upgradation / Capex plans.\nI understand that my analysis is at a nascent stage and I need to dig deeper.

Wider equity base is required both for BSE main board migration and proper valuation. I will bat for bonus in the upcoming AGM.\nayushmit:\nThe EC approval has been pending for long and has been an overhang for the stock. Any thoughts as to how can the company grow if the don’t get approval? I understand that even for doing brown-field expansion they need approval?\nThey did expansion in FY19 within the existing premise. More than EC approval, I am betting on prudent product mix which was the growth driver for the last many years. I know, after some point, any company can’t grow topline merely prefering higher value added products but still besides EC approval and further capacity expansion, I am hopeful about growth due to prudent product mix and value added products\nayushmit:\nOther concern I have is - other than the 2 key management people - who are the other key employees? I see very low salary etc and remains a concern for long term growth and sustainability.\nSanjay Marathe and Girish Shah - they are the driving force of the company and all key decision makers. Apart from them, in my view, all remaining employees are in normal payroll (as of now). Few employees are associated with the company for decades but they are neither decision maker nor have ownership interest.\nayushmit:\nI also don’t see investments in R&D etc or details on future products.\nThe company is too small for separating R&D division or any such. One of the promoter, Sanjay Marathe has in-depth technical expertise, R&D and product selection might entirely coming from his brain. Another promoter Girish Shah also has in-depth technical know how but mostly oversee marketing, customer relation and all other matters.\nAnother point I like to share is that, I had interacted with a lot of SME companies in the last 3 years and found Chemcrux management (Mr Girish Shah) is the only one that consistently “UNDER PROMISE - OVER DELIVER” while other SME promoters always promise tall! If you follow post FY18 management commentary (check BSE announcement during May 2018), you will find they talked about 30% growth guidance in FY19 due to expansion. However, they outscored their own guidance with approx 75% topline growth in FY19. Further, in last year during company visit, Mr. Girish Shah told me don’t expect similar 75% growth in FY20, rather guidance was no such growth in FY20. However, in FY20 topline registered 4.5% growth with 14% jump in net profit! Again in FY21 guidance they mentioned about the probability of impact in profitability due to COVID-19 lockdown and all. Let’s see whether once again they can outscore their guidance.\nAs per my experience, it is next to impossible to predict growth correctly for any small business (not talking about large companies) due to the ever changing business dynamics. I can’t say with assurity how much my own business can grow in the coming years as there are always a lot of moving variables. So, apart from large established business (like RIL, TCS, Infy etc), guidance from any small company should not be considered seriously. However, while a small company like Chemcrux always outscoring its own guidance, it requires serious attention and offers testimony about the management quality!\nDisc - Invested since 2017','Jul 22, 2020 3:20 pm'),(3175,340,623,'prasenjitp04:\nYes, once equity capital reach 10cr+ then they can move to normal BSE segment with no limitation of minimum purchase quantity.

Players like Reliance industries have marginsal advantage of captive Gas on limited extent, but for other Refiners/Petrochemical players like GAIL, Haldlia, IOC; the cost of production would continue to remain higher, in my opinion, since they depend on imported crude/gas for ethylene crackers.\nSecond point, global price decline on excess supply may be another point altogether which is difficult to predict. Further, the important point from Dai Ichi perspective would its ability to produce require attribute/quality end-products at lowest cost. Chemical skills and quality of products would play more imporant role for success of speciality chemical player vis a vis only lowest cost which is the case for global commodities like Ethyelene and other petro bulk chemicals. Most of the time, pricing is tolling margin, which is ethylene price+ tolling maring in $ terms. The context of ethylene cost comparison in AGM was to reply to query about supplying to Champion group global operations.

Thank you','Aug 14, 2019 1:41 pm'),(3222,341,73,'Find enclosed my notes from Dai Ichi AGM held on August 13 2019.\nStatus of new plant: Dahej plant is expected to start in three phases. The first phase was Oil chemicals which has commenced production from March 2018. The second phase was Ethoxylation which commenced from October 2018, The last third phase would be completed once reactor from Karaswadi units are relocated to Dahej.\nFactors affecting Dahej plant production\nThe company has now capability to manufacture 200 product s. Each product has separate SOP/ logic which needs to put in place before production can began. This affected production volume\nThe company planned to shift 27 reactors (mainly Balancing equipment) from Pune to Dahej on closure of plant. While the cost in book is around Rs 4-5 crore, new equipment replacement cost for same would be around Rs 45 Cr. The labour objection to shifting of reactor and limited support from Local administration delayed this shifting which also affected production adversely.\nPune workers who were shifted to Dahej, had experience to operate manual plant. When new automated plant started, it took some time for the experience team also to cope up with new production system. Things are now broadly sorted out with necessary training being provided to experience team. Further, now company intends to recruit fresh talent for additional requirement then just to relocate Pune team.\nCurrently Dahej has Ethoxylation capacity of around 430 tonnes per month. However, since the balancing equipment is not in place, the company used main reactor for value addition which affect production volume and current capacity is only around 350 tonnes per month. The company attempted to utilize PPD reactor which have busy season in year-end during the lean period to improve production volume for manufacture construction chemicals. After shifting all balancing equipment from Karaswadi, the company would achieve total capacity of around 30,000 tonnes per annum. At present, the company is able to achieve production of around 14-15,000 tonnes per annum.\nSales : While the company has orders in hand as on previous year AGM date, due to issues in production stabiliisation, there was limited supply which affected revenue during FY19. There was increased volume requirement for Agricultural product from the south based Agro company but supply constrained curtailed sales of Agro product as well during FY19. One of unit supplied by GMM Pfaudler was not working as per affected production. Despite issue with equipment, the management said that GMM is best equipment supplier.\nNalco JV : Due to very aggressive bidding, the JV did not win tender to supply to major customer. The customer is not satisfied with product supplied by the competitor and hence management is confident to get back business whenever next tender are announced. Prices quoted by a local competitor were significantly lower (~25% of JV quote not sure for this number) and difficult to even break even in the management opinion. The customer put the penalty in case performance does not meet the standard. So the customer is protected too an extent. In Indonesia, Clariant quoted very aggressively and emerge as winner.\nThe company research division has developed couple of products with consultation of Nalco and is in process to manufacture to supply to Nalco in Middle East region. These products are mainly used in Oil field area and the company has already installed reactor to manufacture same. It expects production to begin from November 2019. (First product capacity 100 tonne per month and second product would have capacity of 60 tonne per month, expects gross margin around 30%.) the management intend to have reasonable margin in order to get maximum share from Nalco sourcing.\nFuture plan: At full capacity expected to achieve by 2023, the company would estimate sales to reach ~ 300 Crore. The company is looking at all free assets and monitise same to reduce the debt on balance sheet. In July 2019, the company achieved Cash break-even of operation. The company aims to achieve sales of around Rs 145-150 Cr during FY20. This is with assumption that Pune equipment is shifted within couple of months to Dahej. It would take around 3 months for installation of equipment and commencement of production from relocated reactors (So effectively no benefit of Pune equipment during FY20). The company is intending to file Writ in Mumbai High Court seeking assistance from local administration and police to move equipment from Pune to Dahej. The management does not see any issue as they have already paid compensation to labour as stipulated in Industry court order.\nBenefit of Buss Technology: Speed of reaction is very quick. Precision of product is very good. It is only Indian company to have successfully implemented Buss (Swiss ) Double Loop technology.\nDisclosure: I hold token position in the company and view may be biased.

Its past experiences have helped the company shape its current business model\n* The companyâs business model can be replicated but economics would not be easy to replicate because of the following reasons : 1) Cheap raw material sourcing from various Asian countries 2) Low cost manufacturing with a large base (Jaipur, India) 3) Expert team of people in its core markets to catch trends and attract customers 4) High fixed costs in the form of airtime/broadcasting costs on TV channels\n* It is not easy for new players to enter the discounted jewellery business and make money because of the competitive advantages which VGL has built around itself.\n* There is a significant operating leverage in the business; the significant fixed cost being airtime on TV (The company derives >70% of its revenues from TV sales). This will allow higher margins to kick in with better sales\n* Strong balance sheet with net debt of INR 250 Mio (Gearing of 0.08) as of 31.12.2014\n* Investments from Nalanda Capital, Prof. Sanjay Bakshi into the company.\n* Promoter integrity â In spite of the CDR, the promoter paid the interest and principal in full and infused funds to the tune of INR 440 Mio when required.\n* If you have the time, do go through http://liquidationchannel.com/ 141 which is a popular channel which VGL runs and sells its products through\nWhat are the risks? :\n* Obsolescence of technology\n* Threat of other players entering the low cost jewellery segment\n* Slowdown in the US and UK markets\nDisclaimer : I have taken small positions in this stock.

It has evolved from Business 2 Business player to Business 2 consumer player.Credits to the company management for the massive transformation.\nLast year companyâs sales from each segment:\nTV: 70%\nWeb: 17%\nWhole sale: 13%\nCompanyâs current business model of business to consumer(B2C) has one significant advantage: Reduced working capital since retail customers pay cash to buy the products(no receivables),in case of wholesale,receivables will increase as a function of sales which will extend the cash conversion cycle.This new model would free up lot of cash which will increase the asset turnover and hence,ROE will inch up.\nAnother major advantage of B2C is when you are in wholesale,you have no pricing power especially when you are a supplier to brutal retailer like Walmart.In the current model,they are free to set the prices on their will.\nIn developed markets like US and UK,growth of retail industry is directly linked with GDPâs growth.As per the companyâs annual report,total jewellery market size is around $60 billions of which 10%($6 billions) belongs to e-commerce.\nNow,we need to check how much value migration from brick and mortar to TV and Web is going to happen for jewellery and lifestyle products.Currently,VGLâs TV sales acocunts for 70% and web is 17%.I think going forward,the ratio will tilt towards web.TV has its own limitations like creating trust and winning customers when you constantly mark down the prices of your products throughout the day.Personally,I have never seen anyone buying stuffs from those TV marketing programmes in my friendâs/colleagus circle.When you constantly offer deal,(I watched their TV for a while,they gave a new deal for every 3 minutes.) that too 90% off on products everyday,people start suspecting it.They started a product with $1200,then marked down to $500,then $300,then finally ended up with $120(may this is the way to engage the customer but I could not understand the rationale behind this.)Atleast ffew times a day is fine,but not all through the day. I am not saying this is not a sustainable model,but how much scalable.We need to understand VGLâs TV sales ,there is no new growth going to happen every year since almost all the households in US and UK have TV already and all are watching these programmes day to day basis. Or,they have to start selling in other developed nations which is not possible since some EU nations like France,Spain,Italy are major sellers of these products.\nSo,the next leg of growth should come from online for VGL if it has to grow further.However,When I did some google search for online gemstones and jewellery surprisingly VGLâs website did not appear in top 25 websites(changed the keywords as well).All of their competitors website are appearing on the advertisements section.They really need to invest a lot on this front.\nTheir US facebook page has close to 350,000 likes which came as a surprise to me which is a good number .This shows the reach of the company in its markets.However,on yelp they had 2 reviews and both of them are negative,they did not bother to respond back to the reviewers(no big deal).But in US,people try to look for credible reviews before putting their money on some unknown websites like liquidationchannel.com 2.\nLet us look at the competition real closer and see if there is a room for VGL to grow:\n1.QVC: Their annual revenue in 2013 is $6.5 billions of which 17% jewelry and 25% lifestyle products.\nThat translates into $1.1 billions from jewellery and $1.6 billions from lifestyle products.\n2.HSN :Annual revenue $2 billions (18% from jewelry and 25% from lifestyle products).\nThat translates into $340 millions from jewelry and $500 millions from lifestyle products.\nVGLâs last year sales were aroud $200 millions and the overall industry growth is around 2% with ecommerce growing faster than that,how much more VGL can grow? That is the bigger question.\nThere is clearly no doubt about its proven business model with high return ratios,asset light model,low-cost producer, just that could not get a hang of how they achieve future growth rate of 20%.\nAnd we need to remember,jewelry being a discretionary item and this is the first one to get hit when recession happens.\nhappy to hear your arguments.','Feb 22, 2015 9:25 am'),(3270,344,398,'Hi Anil,\nThe analogy I gave was with respect to TV sales (And as Sambath below your post has pointed out).

They source it from Asian countries,manufacture in Jaipur in their own facility and sell it to their customers in US,UK,Canada.This is the main reason their gross margin is higher than their competition.\nNow,as per your presentation,future growth will be mostly driven by lifestyle products(currently 90% sales belong to jewelry division) which are produced by third-parties.If that is the case,what is the price difference between its competition and VGL since everybody sources those lifestyle items from China for cheap and sell it in US.Say for example ipad/iphone case,can you sell 30% cheaper than others just like Tanzanite(I donât think VGL will ever make those ipad cases on its own to make it cheaper).If you do that,you will loose your margin,if you donât your customers have no reason to buy from you.So,these lifestyle products are like trading income and not like selling the in-house brands .All these lifestyle products are overcrowded with cut-throat competition.Here,end-to-end vertical integration is not going to add much value.What is your thought on this?\n2.When you say,HSN and QVCâs combined revenues are 52X of VGL ,thus indicating huge scope for VGL growth.Are you talking about market size getting expanded or VGL gaining market share from the existing players in a declining industry?\n3).

There are lots of ladies in the USA including retired women, housewives etc with dollars to spend who get a kick out of the entire auction process and finally seeing the message on screen - “Congratulations, You have won!” The thrill of appearing on TV as a winner is brilliant. The fascination of being able to buy high priced articles at huge discounts is a concept which plays with the human psyche. Free gifts for loyal customers rakes in more loyalty. It is these softer aspects and innovative ideas which makes TLC such a popular medium for its target audience.\nGrowth from online mediums -\nIt is pertinent to note here that TLC is medium agnostic - hence the live broadcasts are on TV as well as the internet. So the old ladies can watch their favorite program and make their bids on their laptops. The platform, hence, is there for VGL to also grow through online mediums\nConsumer discretionary? -\nI’d just point you towards the price points of the jewellery (Average selling price of $20) which really should not affect its sales much during a downturn. It is also for these reasons that you shouldn’t really be comparing it to the QVCs and HSNs of the world.

Has any one got the answers then please respond…\nThis Test and Measurement industry is typically dominated by large well capitalized technology focused firms. This also tends to be intensely R&D focused industry with heavy R&D expenditure just to keep your position. What is the advantage Jasch automation would have in this industry in the long run? Do they have some kind of niche advantage? This knowledge will allow us to try to project the ballpark future for this division (if not exact numbers). Other than the fact that they acquired one small US company I did not find any data on this matter. So my question is …Why should steel/Aluminium plants come to them for sourcing?\n2, The positive factor is they have installed about 100-150 systems across the world over last 15 years and have few repeat customers like Arcelor Mittal steel. But the business is intensely cyclical if you read the management commentary and see the division sales numbers. This equipment is Quality control equipment and hence part of capital expenditure by end user industries. So the fortune of jasch is tied to fortunes of the cyclical businesses like steel, plastics, paper etc. Going forward how they plan to increase the sales YoY? If you see past 5 years then the growth in sales is highly fluctuating. The combined company has shown growth almost every year because when Gauging division is floundering the synthetic leather division is doing fine and vice versa. But if you strip the divisions and analyze separately then the reality becomes obvious. As the base is so small for this division that they should ideally grow YoY even in cyclical industry if they have some competitive edge in the market.\nThe margins look healthy and return on assets also look healthy. But the product is one of a kind purchase by their customers and not a regular consumables that is purchased repeatedly. It also may be non-trivial investment by their customers as part of capex plan and so completely discretionary spending. (Hence cyclical nature of business.) That poses certain risk to the business and valuation must take this risk into account. Forecasting numbers may not be easy for this division. and so does the DCF based valuation. If we want to try relative valuation then do you know any peers in same line of business…electronic equipment or Test & Measurement equipment companies?\nHaving said that, I think if we get more clarity on sustainability of gauging business and most importantly Sources of that sustainability then I think it may help us build the conviction and this may turn out to be interesting opportunity.\nCould any one access the management?

Surprisingly I didn’t find any threads related to the company on the site.\nOverview:\nWas founded as a proprietary business named Banka Enterprises in 2008 by Namita Banka. She was later joined by her husband, Sanjay.\nConverted to a Pvt. Ltd. Co. in 2011 or 2012. Got listed in 2018 on NSE EMERGE.\nCurrently, Namita Banka is Founder and MD while Sanjay Banka is Executive Chairman.\nMarket cap: INR 740 Million (Small-cap)\nBusiness: Provides sanitation infrastructure and turnkey, human waste management solutions and services. Also provides sanitation operations and maintenance (O&M) services to the Indian Railways.\nNumbers and ratios with which company is growing is quite impressive\nPromoter shareholding: 59.11% (0% pledged)\nProducts/Services:\nBio-digester: This technology was developed by DRDO (for soldiers at high-altitude bases) and was transferred to Banka via ToT. This technology is used in bio-toilets.\nBio-toilets: Consists of toilet cabin + multi-chambered bio-tank + bacterial culture (Psychrophile). The modular structure of bio-toilet is a patent-pending technology (as of Jun’19) designed by Namita herself. The average life span of a bio-toilet can be up to 35 years. These do not require sewage connectivity and because the process is self-contained, are also maintenance-free.\nFootLoo: is a low-water flush system, best-suited for environment-conscious people. FootLoo comes in two specifications, one using no water, and one using very little amount.\nPluto: has indigenously developed and patented a small-scale Faecal Sludge Treatment Plant (FSTP). It is based on Geotube technology.\nUrban STP: collaboration with Aqua Nishihara Corporation, working on Japanese technology, Johkasou Wastewater Treatment Technology\nSome random points that I collected from multiple articles, videos, and ARs:\nAs of April’20, had installed: 5,000+ bio-digester, 10,000+ bio-toilets/bioloos (across 22+ states), 2 FSTP\n2,000+ bio-tanks installed in train coaches across India\n13,000+ bio-toilets monitored and serviced daily in train coaches\nAs of August’20, employee count: 1,000+\nWord-of-mouth helps them to get new clients\nUses polystyrene bricks for building toilets\nAverage cost of developing one bio-toilet is around 30-35k (from one source) 85k (from another source)\nFrom FY20 AR:\nIndian Railways (also was their first-ever client) were the largest client and accounted for 81% of FY2019-20 revenues\nUnexecuted order book from Railways: Rs. 500+ million\nUnexecuted order book from non-railways: Rs. 400+ million\nHas raised Rs.38 million of ECB (External Commercial Borrowing) from WaterEquity, a US-based asset manager focused on solving the global water crisis\nKey priorities (i) Reduce Railways service concentration (ii) Full-stack offering in wastewater & fecal sludge treatment plants (iii) Disinfectant services (iv) Deliver superior returns.\nFinancials of last 8 years (from Morningstar):\nOpportunities for company:\nIndia ranks among the top 10 countries with poor sanitation facilities. India has around 7,000 towns with less than 1 million population. Almost all of these towns as well as urban poor do not have an efficient underground sewerage system connected to sewage treatment.\nOnly 24% of Indian cities are connected to a CSTPs (centralized STP)\nSince the inception of Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan and various other such initiatives taken up by the GoI, the mindset of people towards sanitation is gradually changing as they realize the necessity of it. After building a large no. of toilets across India, GoI is now focusing on the treatment of waste via ODF++ (open defecation free). This opens up opportunities for the company.\nChallenges/Negatives:\nDaily volumes traded are very low (less than 20k on average)\nNegative FCF in past multiple years\nGovernment business is through tendering and has witnessed significant pricing pressure.\nOne remaining challenge in promoting toilets’ use involves the perception among some Indians that sanitation is not worth paying for. Many are comfortable with defecating in the open.\nIn rural India, problems relating to Vastu, land, etc prevail. But they take care of it by building toilets in whatever way they want by changing the exterior, technology, design a little bit because they have learned that if they force a single model/design on everyone, then some do not use it only\nInitially faced a challenge that not many people look forward to investing in these sectors and so there was shortage of grants/funds’.

Their USP is vertical integration - they are the only player who manufacture silica from sand and then turn it to optical fibres. They have facilities in China and Brazil as well\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of data explosion and digitization. To give you some context here - India today has around 70-80 mkm fibres laid out Vs close to a billion km laid out by China and 500 mkm by South Korea\nThe current airwave mode of data transfer in India is not sufficient for 4G roll out and they require optical fibre. Reliance Gio, Vodafone and Airtel have huge capex planned for 4G which will require overhaul of existing towers as well as new towers with optical fibre connectivity\nGovernment has huge plans for fiberization. Read this 86\nDemerger play: The company today has 2 businesses - Telecom and Power. By end of fy16, the telecom division will be demerged and the power business will be taken private. Total company today is valued at around 4000 Cr mcap and the unlisted business will be worth 800 Cr. If you wish to exit the power business, you will get around 22 Rs preference share within 30 days of demerger. Read the demerger details here 60\nValuation of telecom business: Telecom business will do EBIDTA of around 450 Cr. They have already done 250 Cr in H1 Fy16. Total debt transferred to telecom division is around 1000 Cr and the interest outgo will be 100 Cr. Post depreciation of around 19 Cr per quarter and tax of 28%, the PAT comes to be around 150 Cr. At market cap of ~2600 Cr [3400*(86-22)/86] of the telecom business, you are getting this business at around 17 PE. Telecom if a 20+% EBIDTA and 25% ROCE business. So, I think it is a good buy\nManagement reported that they plan to take their revenues from around 1500 Cr today to around 8000-9000 Cr in the next 5 years.They are doubling the OFC capacity from 7 million cables to 15 million cables by Q4FY16…this should provide a revenue & PAT boost to the company since capacity utilisation is high…However margin will deteriorate since OFCs have a lower margin than plain optical fibres…But management has guided for EBITDA margins in the range of 21-22%\nEnd to end solutions provider: Currently, around 10% of their revenues come from service and solutions- design, implementation, software etc. They plan to grow this business going forward.\nSterlite’s telecom division acquired Elitecore Technologies last quarter (Revenue: 147 crore; EBITDA: 16 crore; debt free company). Elitecore’s CAGR is 25%; company has been profitable for the last 7 years\nAnother important point is that company has a large NFS order in J&K (~Rs1300 crores). The revenue impact of the order starts from Q2 onwards…In FY15 company had just recognised 68 crores of this revenue.\nRisks to this thesis:\nConsidering the bad management reputation (Vedanta group - Anil Agarwal), I am sceptical that a plain commodity like OF and OFCs have EBITDA margins of 21-22%. My suspicion is that the company is transferring the power segment profits to the OF/OFC segment. This makes the power segment numbers look bad enabling the company to take the power division private since most shareholders will opt for preference shares looking at the bad nos. The major risk is that the telecom division margins suddenly drop off after the demerger…If you have a look at FY14 and FY13 nos…telecom segment had decent margins of 12-13% which have now increased to 22%…The management attributes the increase in margins to improving capacity utilisation and operating leverage…But is such an expansion in margin really possible due to increasing operating leverage only ??\nMgmt salary is really high…however I wouldn’t want to miss out on a stock on just this fact alone…The cost of missing out is high…\nGovernment orders such as NPS etc generally have payment issues and can impact receivable days\nOverall, we are getting a great business with 25% ROCE at less than 20 PE. I am expecting a good rerating post demerger. Many past demerger plays have been very rewarding - Entire Alembic group had market cap of 900 Cr in 2010 and now Alembic Pharma itself is 13000 Cr and Alembic ltd is 1000 Cr.

Noted some important points from business point of view (left numbers).\nEven the most conservative estimates of fiber deployment for 5G network factor a jump in fiber consumption of at least 2.5x compared to 4G. Extensive fiber demand is here to stay for another 10 years based on 5G deployment cycle in next say 8-10 years. We believe that this trend will continue with as the networks grow tomorrow with much higher bandwidth coupled with ultra low latencies that will magnify the role of fiber in the overall network CAPEX. 5g cycle is just starting now…it in itself is not contributing anything to our revenue right now.\nIn Calendar year 2017, we witnessed global demand for fiber surpassing preform capacity for first time ever keeping the tightness in fiber supply demand dynamics. We expect the global demand supply mismatch to persist in 2018 and growth in global demand will continue to enable the absorption of plant capacity additions on the preform side.\nRegarding question on global preform shortage and new global capex to coming online in FY19 (2 year cycle) - We keep a tab of the new capacity, but it is difficult to know exactly when. The industry continues to be slightly not very open but what we are looking essentially is that the supply demand situation will continue to be tight, which is reflecting of the fact that we are actually now booking orders for the calendar year 2020 as well. So we are fully booked for 2018, we are largely booked for 2019, with the expanded capacity and we are booking some for 2020 as well. Reflection comes from what we hear from the suppliers and customers. The fact that our customers were wanting to give us contracts for 2020 gives us the confidence that the supply tightness might continue till then.**\nDelivering both products and services and measuring outcomes at multiple stages of the value chain has provided invaluable perspective and insights enabling us to reengineer products and processes to solve customers’ network requirements and increased asset monetization. As the only company with end to end capability that extends it to software, we are uniquely poised to cater to the present and emerging needs of the networks of the future.\nNow have a very balanced geographical split to our revenues with both exports and domestic business contributing equally to the top line and equally strong future outlook.\nOut of 3,500 cr order, 75% will be system integration and about 25% is O&M for the subsequent 7 years. No EPC, no products. The margin profile is very similar to what we have for the other system integration business, about 12% to 14% (PAT level).\nUtilization - Fiber running very close to 100% and OFC running at about 90%.\nMargin improvement in Q4 is a result of couple of things. In short - 23% last year to 25% is due to better volumes, better operating leverage and more value added products. In detail - One that the products and services the ratio has been more skewed towards product. We have delivered better volume as compared to Q3 particularly on the fiber cable side where we have seen a better utilization coming close to 90% of capacity which was running at about 60% till last quarter. This one is sustainable. Number two, in terms of contribution of the new product continues to be there, so that is similar to last quarter, so that again plays a role. We can see part of this margin sustaining. We believe in growing the absolute value of EBITDA, the margin is a derivative of mix while if you look at from the full year perspective, we are still at 25%, so I think as long as we continue to maintain this kind of revenue mix, we would see that 24%, 25% margin. But absolute EBITDA we are quite sure that it will continue to improve on quarterly basis.\nMargin in cable business is lower than fiber business but at the same time since we are now getting much better utilizations for OFC, operating leverage is coming in. So that is how the overall margins are improving and showing in the final result. Fiber business has great operating leverage and on\nOFC the capacity utilization is increasing quarter-on-quarter.\nFundamentally continuing to be very-very bullish about the Indian market.\nThe order book currently is 5000 crore about 80% of which is towards the product side. With the Navy order happening, the overall mix will start becoming 50%:50%. It is very difficult to predict as to how the revenue profile will start looking three years from now.\nWe do not need to compromise on the margins with new customers (new geographies).\nPrices continue to be very-very strong both at the spot level as well as long-term level.

There are various on-going projects in the U.S., China and India. The\nprojects are expected to add up to 3,000 tons of preform capacity. In addition, the increase in capacity could bring 55 to 90 million km of new fiber capacity in the\nmarket. There are around 20 major manufacturers across global market, including, Yangtze Optical Fibre and Cable Co., Ltd, Corning Inc, Sumitomo Electric Industries,\nHengtong Optic-electric China and Shin-Etsu Chemicals amongst other players.\nChina, the world’s largest producer of and source of demand for optical fiber preform, produced 6.1kt and demanded 7.668kt in 2016, 41.0% and 55.4% of the world’s\ntotal, respectively, indicating a supply-demand gap of 1.568kt, still in a state of short supply. However, as Chinese enterprises improve optical fiber preform\ntechnology and put production lines into operation, the gap has narrowed gradually, from 68.4% in 2010 to only 20.4% in 2016 and estimated 18% or so in 2021.\nChina has put anti dumping duty on fiber coming from Japan and USA. This is probably good for Sterlite as it manufactures in China as well.\nImportant points :\nexpected demand of preform by 2023 is 31.5kt growing at cagr of 12.2% between 2018 and 2023. Demand exoected to be 25.6kt in 2021.\nIn 2017, there was short supply of 1.75kt in China. New capacity of 3kt is announced. If demand grows by 12%, then there will be net additional capacity of 1kt.\nThis is just for China though.\nReports indicates that China will still be net importer in 2021. Having 18% gap between demand and supply.\nReferences :\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/optical-fiber-preform-market-2018-key-companies-sales-demands-and-forecasts-to-2023-reportsnreports-850882742.html 8\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/global-and-china-optical-fiber-preform-market-2017-2021-1003497228 5\nhttps://www.marketresearch.com/Research-in-China-v3266/Global-China-Optical-Fiber-Preform-10241921/ 5\nhttps://cryptonewsjournal24.com/optical-fiber-preform-market-size-trends-analysis-demand-outlook-and-forecast-to-2026/50662/ 3\nDisclaimer :\nInvested\nThis is in no way supposed to be a conclusive research, I am just sharing something I found during my exploration which is still WORK IN PROGRESS.','Feb 12, 2019 6:51 am'),(3397,347,171,'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/china-s-hot-stocks-get-crowded-as-traders-snap-up-everything-5g 107\nGood news for Sterlite, China mobile announces big order for optical fiber cable.

I had a question, a couple of questions on Optical actually. First of all, I was curious on your view on the, just the industry supply situation. My understanding is that there is quite a bit of excess capacity in China for fiber and cable. I understand you cannot move seamlessly across the globe. But it seems to be making its way into Europe, are you guys factoring in any of those any of that excess supply into your model, should we be concerned about pricing pressure risks as the year goes on. And then I have follow-up.\nWendell P. Weeks – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nI think on that would, Steve. You are seeing that to the extent that is going to impact us, is already in our financials. The actual level of excess inventory in China has been trending down, there is still some to come. I think how rapidly the Chinese market tightens up will depend a lot on this upcoming tender, it will see out of China Mobile. We anticipate that is part of this, they will lay forward a little more clearly what their 5G plans are and therefore what they’ll need to densify that network. If that comes out with a very aggressive set of 5G builds, then the China market itself will tighten up very significantly. If it’s not quite as aggressive, we’ll just have a little bit longer-tail. We think we’ve got the bulk of that in these numbers.','Feb 27, 2020 3:42 am'),(3406,347,146,'Moneycontrol 5\nSterlite Tech share price slips, board to consider share buyback 5\nThe stock has cracked more than 58 percent in the last six months.','Mar 19, 2020 12:07 pm'),(3407,347,120,'Something to note\nhttps://www.chinamobileltd.com/en/ir/operation_m.php 3\nLook at the 5G package customer numbers.

Noted some important points from business point of view (left numbers).\nEven the most conservative estimates of fiber deployment for 5G network factor a jump in fiber consumption of at least 2.5x compared to 4G. Extensive fiber demand is here to stay for another 10 years based on 5G deployment cycle in next say 8-10 years. We believe that this trend will continue with as the networks grow tomorrow with much higher bandwidth coupled with ultra low latencies that will magnify the role of fiber in the overall network CAPEX. 5g cycle is just starting now…it in itself is not contributing anything to our revenue right now.\nIn Calendar year 2017, we witnessed global demand for fiber surpassing preform capacity for first time ever keeping the tightness in fiber supply demand dynamics. We expect the global demand supply mismatch to persist in 2018 and growth in global demand will continue to enable the absorption of plant capacity additions on the preform side.\nRegarding question on global preform shortage and new global capex to coming online in FY19 (2 year cycle) - We keep a tab of the new capacity, but it is difficult to know exactly when. The industry continues to be slightly not very open but what we are looking essentially is that the supply demand situation will continue to be tight, which is reflecting of the fact that we are actually now booking orders for the calendar year 2020 as well. So we are fully booked for 2018, we are largely booked for 2019, with the expanded capacity and we are booking some for 2020 as well. Reflection comes from what we hear from the suppliers and customers. The fact that our customers were wanting to give us contracts for 2020 gives us the confidence that the supply tightness might continue till then.**\nDelivering both products and services and measuring outcomes at multiple stages of the value chain has provided invaluable perspective and insights enabling us to reengineer products and processes to solve customers’ network requirements and increased asset monetization. As the only company with end to end capability that extends it to software, we are uniquely poised to cater to the present and emerging needs of the networks of the future.\nNow have a very balanced geographical split to our revenues with both exports and domestic business contributing equally to the top line and equally strong future outlook.\nOut of 3,500 cr order, 75% will be system integration and about 25% is O&M for the subsequent 7 years. No EPC, no products. The margin profile is very similar to what we have for the other system integration business, about 12% to 14% (PAT level).\nUtilization - Fiber running very close to 100% and OFC running at about 90%.\nMargin improvement in Q4 is a result of couple of things. In short - 23% last year to 25% is due to better volumes, better operating leverage and more value added products. In detail - One that the products and services the ratio has been more skewed towards product. We have delivered better volume as compared to Q3 particularly on the fiber cable side where we have seen a better utilization coming close to 90% of capacity which was running at about 60% till last quarter. This one is sustainable. Number two, in terms of contribution of the new product continues to be there, so that is similar to last quarter, so that again plays a role. We can see part of this margin sustaining. We believe in growing the absolute value of EBITDA, the margin is a derivative of mix while if you look at from the full year perspective, we are still at 25%, so I think as long as we continue to maintain this kind of revenue mix, we would see that 24%, 25% margin. But absolute EBITDA we are quite sure that it will continue to improve on quarterly basis.\nMargin in cable business is lower than fiber business but at the same time since we are now getting much better utilizations for OFC, operating leverage is coming in. So that is how the overall margins are improving and showing in the final result. Fiber business has great operating leverage and on\nOFC the capacity utilization is increasing quarter-on-quarter.\nFundamentally continuing to be very-very bullish about the Indian market.\nThe order book currently is 5000 crore about 80% of which is towards the product side. With the Navy order happening, the overall mix will start becoming 50%:50%. It is very difficult to predict as to how the revenue profile will start looking three years from now.\nWe do not need to compromise on the margins with new customers (new geographies).\nPrices continue to be very-very strong both at the spot level as well as long-term level. We are partnering with our customers particularly large customers so that we can continue to get visibility of volume rather than the realization, because as you have seen, for us volume certainty is far more important than the realization.','Oct 5, 2017 7:54 pm'),(3419,347,982,'Thanks @Mridul.

Even though the opportunity is too-good-to-miss, I concur with @rajguleria that promoter related risks are quite high.\nWhat I’m more sceptical about is the capital allocation policy where dividends are being given out for 140 crores (fy19-20) but there’s a term loan rollover of around 280 crores. As such, it appears that dividends are being paid out of loans which is quite cynical considering cost of equity is so low during growth phase. Note that 50% shareholding is by one of Vedanta’s holding company i.e. 70 Crores\nMy theory is that from the POV of promoter, this is quite possible as Sterlite being a strong fundamental company, can get loans at a very competitive rate as compared to its other entities.\nAs a simple concept, it’s illogical, poor capital management to see loan AND dividend on the cash flow statements. Great companies are those with best capital allocation actions. I’m an extremely high roe business like Sterlite’s execution, it’s criminal not to invest every penny back into growing the business. I remember reading / watching Anand Agarwal mentioning that they have given dividend to please the shareholders. I am sure that is true but for Vedanta. Also, it is apparent that the management is unable to make real long term decisions which are in the long term interest of the shareholders (even if they don’t recognise / understand it).\nLong term value is created by reinvesting incremental capitals that generate incremental cash flows and returns over a loong horizon. That is the underlying crux of Warren Buffet’s stock picks.\nAll this noted, this stock is also one of my first finds and I do sto have some bias towards it. I bought it around 125 levels last year and sitting on good profits but the more and more i read and understand, my infatuation for Sterlite keeps going down.\nWith that said, I won’t be surprised if I end up liquidating my entire position soon.

My Background is mechanical engineer and Masters in business currently working in indirect taxation in government. My Humble request to moderators and seniors if same topic is covered elsewhere you are requested to move this to the requisite thread\nCompany Back Ground :\nThe Company was incorporated as ‘Precision Camshafts Private Limited’ on June 8, 1992 under the Companies Act, 1956 (“Companies Act 1956”), with the Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra at Mumbai. Pursuant to conversion of the Company into a public limited company, the name was changed to ‘Precision Camshafts Limited’ and a fresh certificate of incorporation consequent upon change of name on conversion to public limited company was issued by the Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra at Mumbai on August 1, 1997. Pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of the Company dated January 10, 2001, the registered office of the Company was shifted from 51, Sarvodaya Housing Society, Hotgi Road, Solapur, 413 003, Maharashtra, India to E 102/103, MIDC, Akkalkot Road, Solapur 413 006, Maharashtra, India with effect from January 10, 2001 and the relevant filings were made by the Company with Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra at Pune\nIt was listed in the exchange on 08-Feb-2016 it’s Location is at : E 102/103, M I D C, Akkalkot Road, Solapur - 413006, Maharashtra, India and virtual address is at http://www.pclindia.in/ 10\nFundamental\nIndustry Type : Engineering / Auto Ancillary Face Value:10 , CMP :110 , P/E ; 22\nManufacturing Facilities:\nPCL has set up four manufacturing units at Solapur, Maharashtra out of which two units are 100% Export Oriented Units (EOU).\nWeakness/Threats :\n• Customer and product concentration Historically, PCL has been dependent on a single product, i.e. camshaft and limited number of customers for significant portion of its turnover. GM (as a group) and Ford Motors (as a group) are PCL’s primary customers, which together accounted for around ~69% of total income in FY16 across various geographies. PCL thus faces the risk of fluctuations in production levels of its key OEM customers.\n• Susceptibility of profitability to exchange rate fluctuations PCL derives significant portion of its revenues (~75% and ~79% during FY16 and FY15 respectively) from exports, and its profitability is thus exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n• Susceptibility to quality standards: PCL products are subject to strict quality requirements and any failure to comply with quality standards may lead to cancellation of existing and future orders\n• Susceptibility of profitability to fluctuations in raw material prices PCL’s major raw materials include resin coated sand, melting steel (M.S) scrap and pig iron. PCL primarily procures them from domestic markets from reputed manufactures. The volatility in commodity prices can significantly affect PCL’s raw material costs and in turn, profitability. Inability to compensate for or pass on increased costs to customers, such price increases could have a material adverse impact on PCL’s financial profile. PCL does not have do not have long term agreements from its suppliers However company is sourcing these from multiple vendors\n• Cyclical nature of auto industry The auto components industry is ancillary to the automobile industry. Demand swings in any of the auto segments have an impact on the auto ancillary demand. The demand scenario is impacted by general economic or industry conditions, including seasonal trends in the automobile manufacturing sector, volatile fuel prices, rising employee expenses and challenges in maintaining amicable labour relations as well as evolving regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements and other factors\n• Labour problems: in past in 2013-14 company has faced problems from labour unions but now PCL have hired third part unskilled workers from the contractors\nRationale of investment / Strengths\nPCL’s established track record of manufacturing of camshafts, long-standing relationship with globally reputed client base, wide and diversified geographic presence and PCL’s strategic and technology tie-ups with world’s leading camshafts manufacturers and ongoing capital expenditure (capex) without much reliance on debt.\nLong track record and experienced top management PCL has a long track record of about 25 years in manufacturing of critical engine components and has established strong business relationships with global OEMs. The promoter, Mr Yatin Shah (Managing Director (MD), a first-generation entrepreneur, has a vast experience in the field of engineering and has grown the organization over the years into one of the leading manufacturers of camshafts in India. The promoters of the company are assisted by a qualified and experienced management team which has been associated with PCL for more than 15 years.\nLong association with leading global and domestic OEMs with wide geographic reach PCL has developed strong long-term relationships of more than a decade with large OEMs, both within domestic and international markets. Total client base exceeds 40 leading OEMs, and includes reputed names such as General Motors, Tata Motors Limited, Ford Motors, Hyundai, Maruti Suzuki India Limited, Chevrolet Sales India Private Limited, Mahindra& Mahindra Limited, New Holland Fiat India Private Limited, etc. PCL is the preferred supplier of camshafts to General Motors Company Inc. (GM) and Ford Motor Company worldwide. PCL exports camshafts to various global OEMs covering Europe, UK, China, Brazil, Russia and North America. PCL has been constantly expanding its geographic presence and has been increasing the market share at a global level. Exports form a major portion of the total sales and accounted for ~75% of the total sales in FY16. PCL has tie ups with various international marketing agencies. In order to strengthen the business operations in Asia, the Company has promoted two joint ventures in China.\nHighly advanced manufacturing facilities, technical collaborations with overseas players PCL has developed strong quality systems and its facilities are certified with ISO TS 16949:2009, ISO 14001:2009 and ISO18001:2007. PCL has also entered into an exclusive agreement with EMAG, a German machining and tooling process company, for transfer of certain know-how and technology for manufacturing assembled camshafts. The technical collaboration with the European and Chinese players has enabled PCL implement advanced machinery which aids in lowering the cost per piece.\nImprovement in capital structure and debt coverage indicators, improvement in profitability and strong liquidity position During FY16, the capital structure of the company improved with overall gearing of 0.33x as on March 31, 2016, as compared with 0.83x as on March 31, 2015. Total Debt to GCA (TDGCA) ratio improved to 1.87x during FY16 while Interest coverage remained high at 15.69x during FY16. PCL’s liquidity position improved on the back of proceeds received from the IPO. Current ratio as on March 31, 2016, improved to 2.49x as compared with 1.21x as on March 31, 2015. PCL had a free cash balance of Rs.312.46 crore as on March 31, 2016 (Rs.88.93 crore as on March 31, 2015). Since the capex in near future will be funded using the IPO proceeds, internal accruals will be available for managing the working capital. Furthermore, on January 13, 2017, Rs.62 crore of preference shares held by PCL in CTPL have been fully redeemed, improving PCL’s liquidity profile significantly. During 9MFY17 (unaudited) (refers to the period April 1 to December 31), PCL’s revenue remained flat with TOI of Rs.345.57 crore as compared with TOI of Rs.344.45 crore during 9MFY16. Its PBILDT margin declined to 23.64% for 9MFY17 as compared with 26.29% during 9MFY16 mainly due to higher employee cost. The company reported Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs.45.24 crore during 9MFY17 as compared with PAT of Rs.48.21 crore during 9MFY16\nHigh Barrier to Entry : Only 5 to 6 major player in the market Business is Oligopolistic in nature however ThyseenKupp who is European pioneer in this field is struggling in Latin American market\nRevised Credit rating on dated 24/04/2017 company got revised credit rating from CARE Long-term Bank Facilities : Revised from CARE A- [Single A Minus } to CARE A; Stable [Single A; Outlook: Stable] and Long-term/ Shortterm Bank Facilities : Revised from CARE A-/ CARE A2 [Single A Minus/A Two to CARE A; Stable / CARE A1 [Single A; Outlook: Stable/ A One\nDetailed rating report : http://www.careratings.com/upload/CompanyFiles/PR/Precision%20Camshafts%20Limited-04-24-2017.pdf 8\nRecent Order: PCL has won a global contract from Ford for the delivery of 8 million camshafts over the life of the program, which is expected to commence supplies from 2018-19\nMargin of Safety: IPO price – CMP i.e 180 – 110 =70 which comes out to be (70/180) *100= 38%\nShifting focus from low value product to high value product: Cam shaft casting profit 15- 18 % whereas machined cam shaft offer 30-35% profit which is elaborated by R&D innovation, Capacity Expansion and acquisition, technology collaboration\nPCL, which is a leader (40% stack in global market )in chilled cast iron camshafts, is taking steps to climb the technology curve.

You may please google Vikrantblog to find the link to the article (not allowed to put in link as per forum rules).\nExtract from the post:\nPCL’s goal is to be the world leader in camshafts manufacturing, with 20% share in the global camshaft market for passenger cars. Its a niche auto ancillary company in a oligopolistic business with relatively high margins. Company needs to reduce its dependency on GM and Ford. PCL got headway in Japanese market with chilled ductile camshaft technology.\nCamshaft Market:\nGlobal market for personal vehicle camshafts is estimated to be ~100 mn units worth Rs. 7,000 cr per annum. The market for camshafts is oligopolistic in nature with only 4-5 major players. Key players are ThyssenKrupp, Federal Mogul Goetze, Linamar, and Mahle AG.\nHistorically, OEMs used to cast and machine camshafts in-house. With increasing volumes and focus on lowering costs, OEMs have majorly outsourced casting. Around 33% of camshaft casting & machining is still done in-house by OEM’s.\nMahle and Riken Corp are the main competitors for PCL in domestic market.\nPCL’s revenues have grown at CAGR of 10% over last 5 years at consolidated level. PAT growth has been higher at ~27%. The primary reason for PAT growth is the shift towards higher margin machine cast camshafts. Machine cast camshafts yield operating margins of ~35% against 18% from forged cast camshafts. The contribution of machine camshaft is around 20% to overall mix in terms of volume. This is expected to increase to 45% as per management, which should push the operating margins closure to 30%. PCL has the reputation of the highest operating margin auto-ancillary business.\nEV presents a grave challenge to the business model going forward.\nDisclosure: Not invested.','Nov 16, 2017 9:26 pm'),(3553,350,1014,'yourraj:\nPrecision Cam shaft\nbut it needed in hybrid vehicle which works on electric + mechanical','Nov 16, 2017 11:12 pm'),(3554,350,30,'During further digging in to internet I found another report which I want share amoung the VC community by edelweiss which covers company’s detailed report\nedelweiss.in 136\n136\ne8ee3ff0-f6c8-41f8-965c-5553acfb15b1.pdf 136\n2.30 MB','Nov 22, 2017 6:17 pm'),(3555,350,1015,'Yourraj,\nI find it disappointing that the report does not discuss the threat posed to the company’s hold by electrical vehicles.

The cost and time of finding alternative suppliers for the critical component is much higher .\nBasically cam shaft is an component which is central shaft of engine and regulate the timing of the valve opening in individual cylinders of engine .\nAnother Toyota is talking of Hybrid cars first than to fully EV and as per my knowledge engine works on otto cycle and Atkinson / miller cycle . And I am sharing this from quora,\"\nI can only describe Atkinson cycle on basis of Toyota/Lexus technologies, as different manufacturers use a bit different tecniques at this point. In fact if you read about the original Atkinson engine then you will find it is a totally different thing. Toyota has no so called Performance hybrids so they use different camshafts and engine block heads. Toyota hybrid engines are capable of only Atkinson cycle. Lexus Performance hybrids use different camshafts and multiple injection (port and direct) and are capable of working in both Otto and Atkinson cycles thus achieveing both economy and high engine power output when required.\nMind that Atkinson cycle engine has idling speed of 1200 to 1800 rpms as a single engine it will not work as its output on lower rpms is poor but it is compensated by electric motor/s in a hybrid vehicle. And at high rpms it is the other way around. Atkinson cycle engine is usually paired with CVT or E-CVT to further optimize consumption and power output.\nAtkinson cycle programming in Toyota/Lexus engines holds intake valve up to a middle of compression stroke at the same time next firing cylinder intake valve is also opened and air/fuel mixture that is pressed out of one is directed into another cylinder thus reducing pump loss. So when no power needed, engine of 3500 cm3 works as a 1800 cm3 with only half of its capacity… At that point engine is running at idle to take care of charging duties.\nHigh idle is required for charging and Atkinson cycle engine would otherwise be unbalanced and prone to misfiring.\nThe point is that some of modern Otto cycle engines allready are able to behave as a sort of Atkinson cycle using only Variable Valve Timing techologies. Though for now it is only used for quicker warmup function. Like it was allready mentioned Atkinson cycle engine is more efficient thermodynamically. Toyota/Lexus engines only heat up to 60 C of engine coolant temperature and 93 C is its maximum. Unfortunately that also means they are easily succeptable to overheating damage…\"\nAlso\nAtkinson and Otto are very similar. Atkinson uses slightly different timing for valve opening and closing events – in particular, the intake valve stays open as the compression stroke begins. This difference results in increased fuel efficiency, but decreased peak power. It’s common in hybrids because those are the most focused on efficiency, and the electric motors can compensate for the horsepower deficit.\nFrom a mechanical standpoint, the only thing that needs to change between an Otto cycle and an Atkinson cycle is the camshaft(s), along with a corresponding change to the engine computer’so programming to adjust fuel delivery accordingly.\nWikipedia articles regarding the operating cycles may be better help regarding technical explanation\nAtkinson cycle has a larger expansion ratio than compression ratio. This leads to more thermal efficiency as more heat is extracted which, otherwise, would have got wasted in exhaust. The power output would be lower in Atkinson cycle engine as compared to a similar sized Otto cycle engine.\nIn Hybrid vehicles, one engine cylinder is removed to accommodate the electric motor as the electric motor will provide power similar to the one cylinder and the IC engine with one cylinder less will be more efficient than the original engine with all cylinders.\nAnd hybrid vehicle need Cam shafts\nThanks and regards','Nov 24, 2017 12:57 am'),(3557,350,30,'I have sent email to their investor relation company and CFO a copy of same is here\nKing Attn: Mr Ravindra R.

If they feel it is their duty to respond to simple questions asked by minority shareholders who are also truly part owners of the business, then they are friendly. Otherwise they are too busy or they dont care.\nBut equity dilution of 50% would be a stronger reason for assuming there is unfriendly attitude of the management towards powerless shareholders. This has negatively affected them as the earnings on the share they own has reduced proportionately to the rate of dilution.\nUncertainty\nCamshafts will be become obsolete if in future, people go for Electric Vehicles.

You may please google Vikrantblog to find the link to the article (not allowed to put in link as per forum rules).\nExtract from the post:\nPCL’s goal is to be the world leader in camshafts manufacturing, with 20% share in the global camshaft market for passenger cars. Its a niche auto ancillary company in a oligopolistic business with relatively high margins. Company needs to reduce its dependency on GM and Ford. PCL got headway in Japanese market with chilled ductile camshaft technology.\nCamshaft Market:\nGlobal market for personal vehicle camshafts is estimated to be ~100 mn units worth Rs. 7,000 cr per annum. The market for camshafts is oligopolistic in nature with only 4-5 major players. Key players are ThyssenKrupp, Federal Mogul Goetze, Linamar, and Mahle AG.\nHistorically, OEMs used to cast and machine camshafts in-house. With increasing volumes and focus on lowering costs, OEMs have majorly outsourced casting. Around 33% of camshaft casting & machining is still done in-house by OEM’s.\nMahle and Riken Corp are the main competitors for PCL in domestic market.\nPCL’s revenues have grown at CAGR of 10% over last 5 years at consolidated level. PAT growth has been higher at ~27%. The primary reason for PAT growth is the shift towards higher margin machine cast camshafts. Machine cast camshafts yield operating margins of ~35% against 18% from forged cast camshafts. The contribution of machine camshaft is around 20% to overall mix in terms of volume. This is expected to increase to 45% as per management, which should push the operating margins closure to 30%. PCL has the reputation of the highest operating margin auto-ancillary business.\nEV presents a grave challenge to the business model going forward.\nDisclosure: Not invested.','Nov 15, 2017 2:45 pm'),(3574,350,663,'I am not someone with charting skills.

It switched to manufacturing of dye intermediates from 2000 .Over the last 15 years company has done backward integration by putting up capacities for manufacturing RMs used in dye intermediates. It has a capacity of 8000 MTPA for dye intermediates. Main dye intermediates compounds involve Gamma Acid, K-Acid, Vinyl sulphone, R-Salt, Meta Ureido, etc. The company is the worlds largest manufacturer for K Acid. Dye intermediates are used for making dyes which are further used for colouring textiles.\nIn H1 FY 2017 this dye intermediate division contributed to 72 percent of revenues of the company. The clients of the company include big companies Huntsman Corporation USA, Arochroma Switzerland. Its operated currently at an utilization level of around 70 percent. The realisations of vinyl sulphone is Rs. 400/ kg and of Hacid is Rs. 425/kg. Vinyl sulphone is a product which is in great demand, due to the closure of factories in China(environemental concerns) and price of this product is expected to remain high., as per the guidance given in the Q2 concall. (http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/what-risevinyl-sulphone-price-means-for-indian-dye-makers_7459061.html 9)\nhttp://www.textileexcellence.com/news/details/1081/dyestuff-makers-will-see-revenues-rise-of-40-50--this-year 26\nSince the major focus has shifted from China to India for the manufacture of these products many Indian companies like Kiri Industries have been putting up huge capacities for the manufacture of these products. However given the fact that Shree Pushkar is completely backward integrated it should be able to fight competition on a price basis. The world market for dye intermediates and the amount produced in the factories of China need to be studied to get a better picture.\nThe company has decided to forward integrate by starting the manufacturing of reactive dyes. Reactive dyes is a special type of dye which makes covalent bond with the fiber and become a part if it. It has put up a plant of capacity 3000 MTPA which started its commercial production from May 2016. The capacity will be increased to 6000 MTPA by Q3 2017 with a marginal capex of 5 cr. According to latest concall the management says achieving a capacity utilsation of 35- 40 % will break even this project. The amount of capital involved in this expansion and forward integration plan will be around 60 cr. The money for this expansion plan was raised via an IPO in August 2015. (61 cr was raised).\nOne of the great features about this company is that it has a zero waste discharge factory. Effleunts generated from one product manufactured are used to make other products. Products like fertilisers , soil conditioners and cattle feed are made by these waste effleunts.\nFertiliser\nSSP , NPK , SOP , Soil conditioners are some of the products made in this division. FY 16 sales of fertilizer volume was 55606 MT and revenue was 48cr.( 20 % of total). The capacity utilization of the division was 48 percent implying a capacity of 1.16 lakh MT. The sales were a bit low last year due to delay in monsoons. The company obtained a NPK fertilizer license after a struggle of 2 years. 20000 MTPA capacity was put up which got commissioned in Feb 2016.\n10,000 MTPA capacity of SOP is put by the company whose commercial production has started from Sept 2016. HCl is generated as an effluent during manufacture of SOP. Hence to follow zero discharge policy the company will be using that HCl to make calcium chloride granules. 6500 MTPA capacity is planned of calcium chloride whose commercial production has started in November.\nThey have an exclusive marketing arrangement with DCM Shriiram in the fertilizer segment for SSP in Karnataka and Maharashtra. They have launched its own brand Dharti Ratna in Western Maharashtra for soil conditioner.\nAcid Division\nThe products of this division are mostly captively consumed and they include Oleum, Sulphuric Acid , CSA . This division contributed only 4 percent to the revnues in H1 FY17.\nKey Strengths of the Company –\nIt is backwardly integrated hence making the products more cost efficient.\nHas zero debt on its balance sheet.\nIts becoming a one stop shop for the textile industry. The management plans to go into textile chemicals next year, they have already purchased land for it( as said in the latest concall)\nIt is a zero waste company. In fact the effluents are used to make new products making the company more cost efficient. It also saves the cost to treat the effluents.\nThe company has delivered a strong financial performance over the last 5 years.\nRevenue CAGR – 14 % ; consistently increasing capacities by the cash flows generated from the business\nEBITDA CAGR- 18% ; as the OPM has improved over the years. The management believes the OPM is going to be around 20 prcent for the year owing to more value added products and also higher realisations on dye intermediates\nPAT CAGR – 43% ; due to financial leverage as the company has paid down its debt over the years.\nThe manangement has given a guidance of revenue of 350 cr this year followed by 450 cr next year, based on the expansion plans. ( Revenue was 250 cr in FY 17)Also the prices of some of the products are commanding a higher realisations due to higher demand, the company is venturing into forward integrated products, an EBITDA of 20 percent will be achievable.\nKey Risks –\nCompetetion . Since the focus has shifted to India from China , many companies are putting up capacities to manufacture dye intermediates. The market for this segment, the growth expected in the market and the capacities being put up by the cos need to be studied in order to understand this point better.\nThe revival of the factories in China which were shut down for dye intermediates.\nUnpredicatble monsoons is always a risk but that was not the case this year .','Nov 29, 2016 5:40 pm'),(3582,351,1021,'http://dolly-bestpicks.blogspot.in/2016/09/shree-pushkar-chemicals-and-fertilisers.html 305\nin the above link complete details available\nDisc; Invested','Nov 30, 2016 6:56 am'),(3583,351,369,'@Shikhar - Good write-up !\nThe management has given a guidance of revenue of 350 cr this year followed by 450 cr next year, based on the expansion plans.

But anything else where investors can look for a fresh trade or a fresh breakout?\nA: Let me give you the latest development on the dye intermediate front which has been happening in China because if you see China has implemented the strengthened pollution control norms and minister who is in charge of this is taking a daily view on the pollution controls because the dye intermediates companies seem to be a big headache for the Chinese government. And if you see they have a strong presence and actually of this, whatever the ground report I have that the two plants have already closed and the daily monitoring of the Chinese government on this pollution control has seen the prices of vinyl sulphone rising from Rs 225 to Rs 275 and from H-acid from Rs 325 to Rs 375 in India in this last one week. That means both the prices have risen by about Rs 50. That means a rise of about 20 percent and 23-24 percent.\nSo the dye intermediate makers, those who are making vinyl sulphone and H-acid in India, they will stand to gain because if you talk to these industry guys, they are expecting that the situation is going to worsen on the Chinese front and because of the curtailment of the production, the dye makers will be requiring this dye intermediates globally because dye if you see overseas or in the global market, March is seeing the robust demand. And because of that the dye intermediates like vinyl sulphone and H-acid both have a very huge demand.

This will ensure that entire subsidy dues to the fertiliser companies, including `48,000 crore arrears, will be cleared in the current fiscal.\nThis is an unprecedented step, as a major part of subsidy for any year used to be released in the subsequent year/s, leading to liquidity problems for the fertiliser industry and shortage of fertilisers in many parts of the country.

The primary reason for the continued improvement in performance is due to the change in Govt policy in the distribution of subsidy. It has now kept the subsidy for the SSP sector separately within the overall Phosphates & Potassium segment. This has led to faster disbursement of subsidy & improved liquidity & made a material difference to the working of the SSP fertilizer companies.\nThe Govt. has further initiated the process of Direct Benefit Transfer , linked to Aadhar for payment of subsidy directly into the farmers accounts. This process should be completed sooner rather than later as is being done for various other Govt. subsidies. As & when that happens, it would be a watershed moment for the fertilizer sector as it would mean that these companies would get the full value of goods sold directly from the consumer & not wait for subsidy from the Govt. It could potentially re-rate the entire sector. The subsidy would be a matter between the Govt. & the consumer. The farmer will know the true value of what he is buying. The subsidy bill too would come down meaningfully as currently there is no incentive for manufacturers to produce efficiently & modernize their plants.\nThe combined production capacity of the Co. is about 11.13 Lakh MT. The production in 2019-20 has been to the tune of 4.36 lakh MT. The current capacity utilization is less than 50% leaving plenty of scope for growth with very limited future capex, if at all.

The company’s plant is located at Solan, Himachal Pradesh. The company is led by Ghumman and Sandhu families. Mr. NS Ghumman, the MD of the company, is considered to be one of the pioneers in bimetal industry. The company was earlier into manufacturing of cathode ray tube (CRT) but the demand for the product declined significantly post introduction of LED and LCD television.\nThe break up of sales over the past three years:\nShunt Resistors - I am more excited by the shunt resistor segment and will talk about it more. Over the past two years, whatever growth has happened in the company seems to be mainly on account of shunt resistors. Electronic beam welded (EBM) shunt resistors are primarily used to detect current. The company has developed shunt resistors which are used in battery management system (BMS) of electric vehicles. In BMS, shunt resistor play a key role because if the detection of current is not accurate, the current can damage the battery. Although, there are thousands of shunt resistor manufacturing companies in the world, from whatever research some of us have done, it seems that the ones which make shunt resistors for detecting low ohmic current (in micro amperes) and that have low temperature coefficients (able to withstand high temperature and not loose their current detection capabilities) are hardly few. From whatever research some of us have done, it seems that currently there is limited competition for the shunt resistor used in BMS with hardly few players manufacturing it. Furthermore, the key technology for shunt resistor manufactured by the company is the welding through EBM machines. Although, the contribution of shunt resistors in overall BMS is pretty small, but its is a very important part of it.\nThe company has an established relationship with one of the large semiconductor companies based out of US and it has been one of Shivalik’s biggest customers. The customer is a diversified electronics company and manufactures range of electronic components like diodes, resistors etc. The customer supplies shunt resistors to BMS manufacturing companies who in turn supply to electric vehicle manufacturers (Shivalik being a tier III OEM supplier to EVs). It seems that the company has been working on shunt resistors for a long time. As per some scuttlebutt, it seems that company has also been trying to supply directly to EV manufacturers. It takes years to get approval from large vendors due to their stringent qualification criteria. The company also has some of the important certification required for supplying such products for Automobile applications like TS 16949. It also follows standards outlined by the Automotive Electronics Council (AEC). Apart from usage in BMS of EVs, the shunt resistors are also used in smart meters used by electricity distribution companies. With increasing automation of cars, the usage of shunt resistor is expected to increase.\nSnapshot of discussion mentioned in FY17 AR of the company:\nBimetals: Bimetal refers to an object that is composed of two separate metals joined together. Instead of being a mixture of two or more metals, like alloys, bimetallic objects consist of layers of different metals. Bimetals have application where current or temperature detection is required. Bimetals are mainly used in circuit breakers, trippers, electronic alarms, fire alarm etc. The company is amongst the largest players in bimetals in the world. The company has established clients like Honeywell, Siemens, L&T, Havells etc. The company is one of the few (in some case the only one) local supplier of bimetals to many MNC companies. The sales of bimetals has largely remained flat over the past few years primarily as it is a proxy play on real estate which is facing headwinds over the past few year. Furthermore, the size of the market is also limited. The company is trying to make a headway into export markets but getting vendor approval takes time. The company is also working with defence for supply of some material (hardly any sales now) and disc grade bimetals (used in high end geyser).\nThe key thing in both shunt resistors and bimetals is to get an entry into an established customer which also acts as an entry barrier. The company’s major raw material is copper alloy which is being imported currently and is in short supply. The company seems to be able to pass on volatility in raw material prices and forex to its customer. On account of increasing demand of shunt resistor, the company has started working on a capex plan to triple its capacity in both bimetal and shunt resistor space.\nWhat attracted me to the company?\n• Proxy play of EVs: The company has been able to break into the EV space and the demand for the product can be exponential. Furthermore, there seems to be limited competition for the product.\n• Technocrat promoters and focus on R&D: The company is mainly run by the family members of Ghumman and Sandhu family. Most of the family members have engineering background. Mr NS Ghumman himself is considered to be a pioneer in bimetal space. The company seems to have an established R&D and has continuously come up with new products (in the past the company was supplying CRT tubes and suddenly the demand fell of the cliff due to introduction of LED and LCD TVs, company however bounced back from the setback successfully). The company also has a lab to test its product\n• Established customer base: The company has an established customer base in both shunt and bimetal segment. Such customer base does act as an entry barrier for other entrants.\nKey Risks\n• Valuations: This year, the company might do EPS of around Rs.3.5 and is thus trading at PE valuation of 30 times which is not cheap by any means. Furthermore, there seems to be a onetime write off of Rs.6 crore this year (just an assumption) of long term trade receivables (of CRT customers) from P&L out of which around Rs.2 crore seems to have been written off during H1FY18. Despite adjusting that, the stock is richly valued.\n• Technology obsolescence risk and increase in competition: The company faces technology obsolescence risk for shunt resistors. Although, currently there are not many options available for detection of current in BMS, it seems that some other technology like Hall Effect Sensors can replace shunt resistors. Furthermore, the competition for the product might increase with increasing market size especially from Chinese and Korean companies who are leaders in semiconductor space.\nKey Financials\nProfit & Loss account\nQuarterly Results\nBalance Sheet\n(Disclosure: Invested.

They allow you to ‘sample’ the current flowing through it for metering purposes. For instance, there may be up to a thousand Amperes flowing, and that would be very impractical to route through a dashboard ammeter or other measuring circuit. A shunt takes a bit of that flow in a precise ratio and is much easier to handle for measurement.\nPlease correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.\nRecently I was going through a report from Mckinsey on Electric Vehicle and found this picture\nSource: McKinsey 11\nI am sure this shunt resister gets used in one of the processes here.\nComing to Shivalik\nHave you done any Porter 5 Framework on Shivalik?

Few more additional points/risks/unanswered questions on Shivalik\nCompetitive landscape: As of now in ultra low ohmic shunt resistors there are only 2-3 players according to Vishay’s product wise competitive landscape sheet (relevant products highlighted in yellow) Vishay_Compettion_Various_Resistors.xls 115 (290.5 KB). Thus, it seems a limited competition market. However, based on the discussions with some industry guys, they say technologically, there are no entry barriers as such. Hence, it is difficult to figure out, what ensures entry of new players in this segment and what are the entry barriers.\nA significant portion of shunt resistor income comes from Vishay and hence in one of the most promising segment, there remains client concentration risk especially when shunt resistor is likely to be the growth driver for the company\nWe still do not have idea about the overall size of the opportunity. Based on my understanding, shunt resistors of various kind have realization ranging from USD 0.01/piece to USD 1/piece. Probably, given relatively sophisticated nature of the shunt resistor manufactured by Shivalik, it is likely to be in the upper two quartiles. However, even if we take leap of faith assumptions on that, the market size world over may be anywhere from USD 500-750 million dollars if/when all cars turn electric or use low ohmic shunt resistor. There are already at least two very large players with advanced technological capacity (Vishay and Isabellenhütte) catering to large OEM players. Given that Shivalik is a very small player with limited capacity and reach, it may be prudent to assume that for some time at least, they will cater to the demand of larger players and not directly supply to OEMs\nRisk of alternate product: IMHO, this remains one of the major medium term risk as the technological landscape around electronic product basket has been quite dynamic and as Ankit mentioned, it is very much possible that the technology becomes obsolete over next 5-7 years, as competing technologies mature and cost curve tapers down. Shivalik has experienced this first hand as their CRT business was completely wiped out few years ago and it took them more than 5 years to compensate for lost revenue on CRT side. Similar scenario is quite plausible in shunt resistor too\nSome more research material I found helpful in understanding product/industry dynamics:RUB researchers create early warning sy…pdf 31 (207.8 KB)\nPower Metal Strip Battery Shunt Resistor_Vishay.pdf 31 (588.6 KB)\nroland_berger_tab_powering_ahead_20150730.pdf 18 (545.7 KB)\nAutomotive Current Sensing.pdf 21 (235.6 KB)\nIHH_Bauelementebroschuere_engl_02.pdf 14 (1.4 MB)\nVishay Resistors Automotive.pdf 32 (2.4 MB)\nDisclosure: I have a small position at average price of 60.

The second competitive advantage that the company seems to have is on account of their relationship with customer. For automotive customers, we have seen that with Mayur or other companies, it takes year to get an entry into them on account of their stringent testing and selection processes. Also, it seems that there might be a network effect which can also play out here in sense that if you are already supplying to one big and established customer, it might lead to a headway into other automotive companies. Not sure how easy it is to get the automobile certifications, but they might also give some edge to the company.','Mar 30, 2018 9:18 am'),(3657,354,150,'Thanks a lot @desaidhwanil for your inputs. I totally agree with you on the risk part especially the risk of alternate product and how competitive landscape turns out for the product over the next few years. One thing which management told during AGM was that risk of product substitution is low currently (off course no one can predict the future). Also, on market size of the product, one contention I have is that assuming risk of product substitution is low, the demand for the product can grow manifold given the increasing penetration of EVs. Furthermore, what I also understand is apart from BMS of EVs, the increasing automation of cars will also lead to higher demand of shunt resistors.\nOne more thing I want to highlight is the shortage of passive electronic products in the market currently. Lead time for some products is as high as 6 months. A presentation highlighting the same is attached.

I also did little bit of research on the internet regarding the same. Putting forth my views :\nThis looks like an exciting bread-and-butter product mix. One (bimetals) providing a steady state income., whereas the other (Shunt resistors) providing good future growth prospects & better margins.\nWhat I liked :\nWhen it comes to manufacturing shunt resistors, Shivalik is the leader in the country & among top 10-15 in the world. There is not much competition on the national level in this segment. When it comes to the global market, there are Taiwanese, Chinese & Korean players too.\nIn India, there is another Nagpur based company called Hi Tech Resistors, manufacturing low ohmic value shunt resistors. Although, their infrastructure does not seem as developed as that of Shivalik.\nSurprisingly, Shivalik does not appear highly ranked on the Google searches for low value shunt resistors.\nWith a great amount of shift happening towards Electric Vehicles, Battery chargers will be in good requirement., hence the requirement of shunt resistors will surely see a uptick in the times to come.\nGood entry barrier : Not easy for another company to set up a plant. Apart from the money involved., technical expertise is needed. Also, it is difficult to set-up a plant without any firm commitment from a long-term prospective buyer.\nKey Concerns :\nLot of dependency on 1 customer : which is Vishay in this case.\nEven the model nos. of shunt resistor displayed on Shivalik’s website are similar to those of Vishay’s.\nThere is some juggling done though in the model nos. by Shivalik : They have changed WSL (of Vishay) to SBA (of Shivalik). The rest numerics remaining the same.\nVishay_power-metal-strip-shunts-current-shunts_pl0005-1801.pdf 31 (1.6 MB)\nNo direct supply or existing tie-up with any big automotive manufacturer. Good amount of money can be made by supplying to an automotive company directly rather than routing it through Vishay.\nI think., with other global manufacturers of shunt resistors in the space too., Vishay might be playing the dominant role in their relation with Shivalik.\nHall Current Sensors can be the technological alternatives to shunt resistors in the future to come.\nThey are basically non-contact type & offer great degree of ease in connecting on the battery charger board.\nIn simple terms, connecting a wire carrying high value battery current is not an easy thing to do.\nYou have to break it to connect a shunt resistor in between.\nWhereas in Hall Current sensors, it can just pass through the Sensor., without being cut.\nHowever, Hall current sensors are very costly at the present moment.\nBimetals is good., & will see a steady demand. But, I see this segment providing stagnant growth or single digit growth in the near future.\nThere is 1 associate company & 2 JV companies under the aegis of parent company. I personally remain cautious towards such an arrangement as it provides lot of flexibility to the promoters to have inter-party transactions & manipulate the financials in order to get the results they want it to be shown.\nHeavy remuneration : Mr. Sandhu & Mr. Ghumman seem to be eating a big pie of the cake. Their present annual remuneration would be Rs. 2 crore + Rs. 2 crore = Rs. 4 crore total. & whereas the company’s FY 17 consolidated PAT is only still Rs 8.79 crore.\nI find this a red-flag.\nDisclosure : Not invested.','Apr 2, 2018 5:09 pm'),(3659,354,1035,'ankitgupta:\nThe company is mainly run by the family members of Ghumman and Sandhu family.

They can manufacture multi-gauge and multi-material strips. They primarily manufacture Shunts and Bimetals since 1985.\nThermostatic Bimetals: A strip consists of two or more layers of different alloys firmly bonded together. One layer of alloy having higher coefficient of thermal expansion compared to other layer. So when heated, alloys of different materials would expand to different lengths and would change the curvature of the strip without causing any damage to the bonding. This simple property can be used in many electrical applications where 1) Temperature Indication is needed; 2) Control of any parameter against temperature is required; 3) Where compensation in circuitry is required in adjustment to ambient temperature; 4) In application where heat is converted to mechanical energy. There are umpteen applications of Bimetals in electrical equipments like Circuit Breakers, Overload Relays, Energy Regulators, Light Flashers, Automatic Fuses, Pressure Gauges, Electric Iron, Coffee makers, Washing Machine, Baking Oven, Refrigerator, Water Heater, Fluorescent Light Starters and many similar areas. In Automotive, it’s used in Exhaust manifold Controls, Turn Indicator, Oil Pressure Gauges, Circuit Breakers, Oil Cooling Regulator etc. Quality Bimetal Strips are made of “Kanthal” Alloys and other specialized alloys as per requirement. “Kanthal” is the trademark of Iron Chromium Aluminium alloys made for wide range of Resistance and High Temperature Applications. Kanthal is the product of Sandvik group and made with specific heating technology provided by Sandvik. Shivalik has the Furnace bought from Kanthal - Sandvik which they purchased in 2010 when Sandvik sold one unit second hand. May visit www.kanthal.com 8 for more details about the product and technology. It is pertinent to note that Shivalik uses Hot Bonding Process as compared to most volume based Bimetal manufacturer who produce it by Cold Bonding Process. Advantage of Hot Bonding is long coil of material without welding and high bond integrity. Cold bonding needs subsequent sintering process to remove oxides and other impurities from metal interfaces to improve quality of bonding. It is unsuitable for critical high temperature applications.\nShunts: These are also Bimetal Strips only. It acts as a Resistor and made from two or more alloys consist of different Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (TCF). It is defined as “resistance change of a conductor per degree change in temperature”. The lower the TCF, the better the sensitivity (as a thumb rule only) of the shunt as there would be low level of power loss and high level of stability. Shunts can be of many varieties but high precision low TCF Shunts are manufactured from various types of alloys. Some of the major material from which these are made and their thermal or electrical characteristics can be found here: http://www.steam-engine.org/wirewiz.html 8.\nResistors are widely used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, divide voltages and terminate transmission lines. Main use of these Shunt Resistors are found in Energy Meters, Battery Management Systems (BMS) of Electric Vehicles, AC/DC Converters, Inverters, UPS etc. It is manufactured by Electron Beam Welding method by Shivalik Bimetal. This gives a very high quality bonding needed for critical and high temperature continuous application with precision.\nMarket Size: Even though the use of Bimetal is ubiquitous, the market size is small in US$ terms. Hardly there is market of Rs. 1000 cr of Bimetal worldwide as price of a Bimetal strip may be in the range of only Rs. 5/- to Rs. 20/- for manufacturing a gadget costing Rs. 2000/- and component price would be constant even if the higher product range is used. For example, imagine you are buying two electric iron costing Rs. 700/- and Rs. 1000/-. The amount of Bimetal Strip used and its quality would be same in both cases and vary between rs. 5/- to Rs. 6/- only.\nThe demand of High precision Shunt is higher and growing rapidly. This is a key and basic passive component in Electric Vehicles, Electronics of an automobile, Robotics, Internet of Moving Things, Augmented Reality and vertical Farming. There are wide variety of resistors and many suppliers for it. But the specific shunts Shivalik manufactures are mainly used in battery Management Systems (BMS), Intelligent battery Sensors (IBS) and Energy meters. All three are high growth areas. Presently there is shortage of supply due to high demand as can be found here … http://www.advancedmp.com/resistor-shortage-why-and-how/ 57\nTo get an idea of wide variety of resistors and details of their suppliers can be found here https://www.mouser.in/Search/Refine.aspx?N=254363 34\nComing to specifics of Shivalik Bimetal, there is a visible improvement in their numbers over past few quarters and from Shipment records it can be found that they are supplying to Vishay Intertechnologies, a major passive equipment and component supplier in the automotive industry. It is a major achievement for a small player like Shivalik Bimetal in a product range where undisputed leaders are Taiwanese big behemoths. Resistors and Multilayered Ceramic Capacitors (MLCC) are not critical like memory Chips and CPU but a basic building block for completing the passive component basket of supplies. Another major source of supplies would be Medical Equipment market. No precise market size estimate is readily available with me but I consider it to be growing rapidly as seen from shortage of supply and increase of lead time as depicted in above report, Rough estimate is about US$ 24 billion which includes all types of passive equipments.\nShivalik Bimetals is growing its revenue fast in last couple of years and grown from Rs. 98 cr to Rs. 161 cr between 2016 and 2018 (Exports 50% in 2018). Management expects the growth momentum to continue as the specific kinds of shunts they make (among many other varieties), there are only few major suppliers as its a niche product where they developed expertise over many years of in-house efforts in product development. There are many other Tier 1 passive equipment suppliers who are also actively negotiating with them for sourcing their products. Continental Automotive and Hella are two companies along with Mouser who are major names who supply various electronic sensing products in the Automotive industry. We assume, if their supply to Vishay doesn’t constrain them from using their capacity for others then someday in future, they may be able to supply to these guys too.\nPresently they have enough capacity to support the growing demand without much capex as we think the Electron Beam Welding machines are versatile and not yet optimally used.\nThe volume expansion is easier than significant margin expansion. We find no reason why Shivalik Bimetal can’t increase its capacity further and we feel once the present capacity, which is non-optimally used, is fully utilized and they gain trust with Vishay then others may follow suit.\nThe complexity comes in making the stuff owing to the design specification of the buyers. Here the model followed by Shivalik is to get the required specifications, tools and dies from the buyer and custom build to the stringent requirement of the buyer on a long term contract basis with pass through arrangement of any increase in the cost of alloys which are 100% imported. They are the largest importer to India for these specific alloys.\nNumber crunching here is easier as main things to monitor are growth in QoQ volume of sales without decreasing the overall margin and corresponding increase in balance sheet, if any.\nRelevant Point: The company has an associate company named Shivalik Bimetal Engineers Pvt Limited which had a reported revenue of Rs. 0.59 Lakhs in 2014 (the last available data) and deals in similar product lines and another associate named Sugam Logistics which deals in the Logistics operation of the company. Also the company had a bad un-recoverable loan from its earlier product line of CRT Tubes to the tune of Rs. 6 Cr which they are gradually writing off from its books.\nOverall we are quite optimistic about the prospect here.

My limited point would be businesses are never linear. My more than two decade credit analyst experience, the most important point is working capital is never static. At times there would higher requirement and at time there would be release except in case of large FMCG. Working capital is like pulse rate in human body. As we excercise our pulse rate would increase and when we relax/sleep pulse rate would be below normal level. Similarly, when business go for value addition/ new products/ new market, at first instance working capital is most likely to increase. Once company establish its credential and supplier/customer develop faith about quality of product and financial strength of the company, the working capital would stabilise to industry norm.\nBy giving incentive, the company may manage to show figure of better working capital. For instance, many company may discount bills with bank for customer and get advance money with discount. So receivable days would be reduce, but there would contingent liability till the time cusomter of the company make payment to the bank/lender who has discounted bills.\nHence, the limited point is just looking at pulse rate without understand circumstance may lead to wrong diagnosis. Likewise, while the increase in working capital requirement is generally not a good situation, but we also need to look at whether the company is employing resources productilvely or not. I normally consider ROCE(Return on Capital Employed) as the critical ratio. In case of trading companies while asset turnover is high, but margin are thin, as compared with manufacturing value added company where profit margin is high but asset turnover is less, ROCE work as standard parameter across the industries and business in my opinion. I am rather too much simplyfying but it is my understanding.\nSo when I do calculation of ROCE for Shivalik Bimetal, I find constant improvement in ratio over the years.Enclosing my working for same (data soruce Screener)\nShivalik Bimetal (Rs Cr) ROCE Calculation 31-03-2015 31-03-2016 31-03-2017 31-03-2018 31-03-2019 30-06-2018 30-09-2018 31-12-2018 31-03-2019\nPBT 8.43 6.5 13.94 21.86 32.49 8.09 7.92 8.29 8.19\nInterest 3.2 3.9 2.54 3.31 3.57 0.79 0.97 0.84 0.97\nPBIT 11.63 10.4 16.48 25.17 36.06 8.88 8.89 9.13 9.16\nNet worth 60.88 64.99 71.24 85.27 105.54\nBorrowing 44.06 42.48 28.64 35.89 40.06\nCapital employed 104.94 107.47 99.88 121.16 145.6\nAverage Capital employed 106.205 103.675 110.52 133.38\nROCE 9.8% 15.9% 22.8% 27.0%\nSo ROCE (on average capital employed) is improving every year since last 4 years for Shivalik, despite higher working capital.

Of the five million to be offered in the first tender, in 2018, barely a fourth has been supplied by meter companies.\nHowever, EESL, the nodal agency entrusted with the initial tendering, installation and consultancy, says it aims to procure 20 million meters and install two million of these by March 2020.\n“The delay in supply initially did put back the process by six months. But, we are back on track. We have a strong pipeline. The next tender that we will float is of 10 million meters. So, supply will not be an issue,” Saurav Kumar, managing director, told Business Standard .\nIn March, the Union minister for power, R K Singh, announced 100 per cent smart metering in two years. A smart meter has a modem (communication device) and a remote switch by which demand, supply and billing can be monitored and controlled remotely. Data from these is collected in a cloud server. This reduces energy theft, improves billing and bill collection. It also helps power distribution companies (discoms) collect data on demand patterns, for use in planning of supply.\nEESL has installed 400,000 smart meters 5till date, in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. It is in talks with the governments of Rajasthan, Telangana and Karnataka to tender and install these.\nKumar said the areas where meters are operational have already brought benefits for the discoms. For Kesco (Kanpur, UP), NDMC (Delhi) and PVVNL (Meerut, UP), the cumulative net increase in monthly revenue is 15 per cent a month. NDMC saw its revenue shooting up by Rs 507 crore a month.\nSupply constraints have slowed the procurement process. The lowest bidder for the first tender in 2018 was state-owned ITI, which has supplied barely 5,000 meters. EESL plans to blacklist it. It has already blacklisted Keonics. The gap in supply is being met by the second lowest bidder, Genus, which has supplied a million meters. The second tender, won by a Chinese company, was scrapped as the supplier didn’t have the necessary quality certificates.\nThe latest tender this year was won by PT Hexing, which would supply five million meters. The price has come down to Rs 2,200 a meter, from Rs 2,400 in the first tender.\nEESL says the installation model is aimed to maximise the revenues of discoms. A discom needs to pay EESL Rs 70-95 (single phase-three phase) a meter and provide access to billing and consumer data. Meter supply, upgradation of system integration, meter management system and billing is done by EESL. It has tied up with telecom service providers and cloud server ORACLE for this.\nA telecom company earns Rs 6-8 a meter. For UP and Haryana, it tied up with Vodafone and BSNL. System integration takes Rs 20-25 a unit. All this comes from the per-meter payment EESL receives from the discom.\nMeter suppliers have other problems. Many have complained against falling prices, participation of Chinese entities and lack of back-end infrastructure. Several expressed concern that states had been slow in installing these.\nEarlier, Business Standard had reported that large players gave a miss to the smart metering tenders in the past, citing irregularities in the bidding document. Government officials contend leading companies have different communication technologies from what states have. However, they are streamlining this, with the same bid document, technology specifications and back-end infrastructure across the country.\n“Creating back-end infra takes time. The System Integration which will monitor and collect data for all smart meters 5has to be standardised across the country. So, we had to reach out to discoms in every state to use similar technology,” said Kumar.\nHe said a smart meter has multiple benefits. “The system that has been designed will be used for value added services in the future. The same meter can be for pre-paid, for managing peak load, integration of renewable (energy) and time of tariff. It sets the stage for future reforms,” stated Kumar.\nFirst Published: Mon, September 16 2019. 02:12 IST','Sep 17, 2019 12:03 am'),(3694,354,153,'Nickel and Copper for 50% of costs of Shivalik.

Hall effect sensors has offset, i.e. it doesn’t measure zero when there is no current and this error increases with time where as shunts have no such error. Another positive for shunts is its operation on high temperature. Shunts can easily support 150C where as Hall effect sensors are useful only up to 85C. This is huge advantage as 85C is non automotive grade and automotive needs electronic components to work 125C MINIMUM. One advantage Hall effects sensors have is isolation. As batteries are grounded to chassis so if there is no isolation between sensor and battery terminal we would get shock. Shunts need additional circuitry for this isolation where as Hall effect sensors are by design do not touch battery terminals and work on magnetic field effect so no additional isolation circuitry cost is needed. However Hall effect sensors need additional circuitry to deal with offset described above. As on today until these limitations of Hall effect sensors are dealt with we can expect shunts to move ahead in adoption. 85C electronics is strict no to have a component qualified for auto grade reliability and this is one big limitation. The accuracy is non linear above this temperature in Hall effect sensors and shunts are quite stable with up to 1% temperature tolerance. Until this limitation is overcome in Hall effect sensors shunts has an edge.\nShunt manufacturing requires material science and electronics knowledge that Shivalik has and they have started at right time. We had passive components shortage in 2017-18 when EVs suddenly started absorbing all passive components capacity world over suppliers worldwide started looking at alternative sources. I think Shivalik was ready with required products so got big boys of the domain as customers. Automotive is all about reliability. Automotive is usually one generation behind in latest technology available. Say our laptops already had DDR4 but you would not find it in Automotive yet. Reason is automotive reliability testing. The automotive technology providers are struggling to qualify DDR4 to auto grade and we not only are finding new issues but even test equipment’s used needs tweaking. Shivalik is IATF 16949 certified and it takes lot of efforts to build this capability. If Shivalik shunts are auto qualified by a car OEM they would not change their vendor to a new vendor or until they qualify their solution with new vendor again. This works as a moat once we have one component in a car. Auto qualification takes 18 months minimum. Globally shivalik would need to engage with global automotive leaders or OEMs to play at global level. They are with leader so thats good start but they would need to get it qualified and become an approved supplier. Once they are approved with some big name like continental others would come automatically.\nI think key monitorable at the moment is if Shivalik is an approved vendor with a global automotive vendor?

ROCE as per my calculation is around 40% last year. Company is virtually debt free, don’t need much cap-ex till productivity is optimized. 85% of the product is exported.\nIndian inner wear industry Is 17K Cr in 2014, going to be Rs. 32K Cr in ’18 and 59K Cr in ’23; 60% is market for women growing at 15% and 40% is market for men growing at 9% (as per estimate in Page industries AR 2014).\nWorld market is growing slowly and many paid reports are available where the total market size is pegged to be anywhere between US$ 25 billion to 35 billion and growing about 3% to 5% range.\nI am unable to come across name of any large global player in this field and seems industry is fragmented with too many small players. Some names are : Bowmer Bond, Kikuchi Narrow Fabric, Landwell Corp etc and in India Shivam Narrow fabric claims to be the largest player (any information about this company is welcome value addition). But I know of umpteen very small scale elastic manufacturer in Delhi and Kolkata.\nPremco claims to supply to some marquee brands (http://www.premcoglobal.com/credentials.html 18) however, more realistic would be to assume they supply to tier one or tier two level of vendors to these large behemoths. Their top 3 shipments destinations were to …\nQST Industries De Mexico; Elastica Surqui SA (Costa Rica); Telas Elasticas (Mexico) — These companies are the intermediaries for the final buyer like Hanesbrand, Fruit of the Loom, Limited Brands Inc etc.\nMain raw materials are Polyester, Nylon and Rubber and all are produced locally and RM constitute 50% of sales. Out of these Polyester is 25% of the total Sales.\nLast year they sold 929 Lakh Meter of Narrow Fabric at average realization of Rs. 7.5 /- meter. An pdf file is enclosed which gives a rough estimate of setting up a basic narrow elastic business in SME sector. The “bazar” price of per meter of narrow fabric appears to be Rs. 6.5/- per meter.\nThe company I found worth investigating due to high profit growth, strong return ratios, company’s export focus targeting quality customer (so can assume quality better than rest) and increasing growth of premium category inner ware in India and other places compared to the overall growth.\nElastic is one of the most critical part of an inner ware and it constitute less than 5% of the sell price of an inner ware (assuming average sell price 200 and average premium quality per meter is Rs. 8/-). I conjecture that like sanitary ware sector where shift from unorganized to organized sector has happened, a similar trend may be possible in this industry for premium and consistent quality requirement. Secondly, GST, at rate below 25% would surely help the organized sector.\nQuality of accounts: Nothing abnormal. Seems to have over valued the finished goods inventory. If the closing stock is valued at average sale price for the year, then profit would be reduced by about Rs. 2 Cr for the year 2014.\nQuality of Management: Unknown. They take very low salary but I am told that they own Beachfront Villa in Florida. Also, a non-promoter shareholder holding 6% plus share appears to be a relative of the promoters.

However the registrar present was checking the shareholding & filling in this information in the column left blank, and on the attendance register. I noticed from the attendance registrar that most had shareholdings of a single share (and occasionally 2 or 4 shares), so I realized that they were “professional” investors (not to be confused with ordinary small investors / retail investors who might typically hold 50-100-200 shares, and are close to my heart). If I am not mistaken, one such shareholder had even brought his “joint holder” too to attend the AGM.\nSo I was not surprised that when the floor was opened to the shareholders to ask queries, the speakers concentrated on procedural matters, and mostly non-serious queries & observations (except on dividend – this was a valid issue which I agreed with). I also asked a few questions of my own .\nWhen the management replied, I found that my list of queries had been skipped, so I reminded them & one of the directors started replying to the same (I would ask the question, he would answer). To my surprise (and mirth) , couple of the shareholders protested, saying that it would take all day & they had other AGMs to attend   …. obviously with just Rs 100 in the game, there was no real need for them to try to learn anything new about the company they were invested in …… and I must add that I saw them later partaking of the refreshments in quite leisurely fashion, and showing no hurry to scamper off to the next AGM  \nAnyway, I agreed not to “hold up” the AGM, and so I spoke to one of the directors later. My notes are as follows :\n• Though AR mentions only upgradation of plant/machinery at Dadra/Vapi, the company also has a significant expansion planned in Vietnam, which has a low-cost advantage. While they did not share numbers on this, it will be a project in 3-phases, and they will lease the land, rather than buy the land outright for this project.\n• Haynes continues to be by far their largest buyer, but they do not feel it is a disadvantage, as they feel they are just “scraping the barrel” as far as potential sales (primarily of higher value products) to Haynes is concerned.\n• They believe a presence in Vietnam will help them “get to market” in far-east far quicker (which is an advantage) & also enable them to target the China market. In fact Haynes has been asking them to expand their base there since some time.\n• Exports face a lull couple of times a year, so to even things out, they are expanding their range of products catered to in local market, targeting products for seamstresses for example (so that dependence on innerwear market is reduced).So in the lull period they will not need to idle capacity .\n• Competition in the market is very stiff, and (i) speed & (ii) volume capability is of essence, besides quality of course. Industry is also working capital intensive.\n• Crude Oil / Rubber prices affect their raw material prices\n• They are constantly expanding into higher value segments , where margins are higher. They are confident of maintaining margins at current levels going forward too.\n• They are constantly upgrading their plant & machinery, and are proud of the same. The director I spoke to gave an analogy about how India moved from black-and-white tv’s to HD now, similarly they have moved from old outdated technology to the most superior technology.\n• They were happy to inform that local manufacturers like Rupa, Maxwell etc which earlier used to be interested only in the Rs.5-6-7 / metre elastic segment, were enquiring about Rs 12/- per meter products nowadays.\n• Jockey is a buyer (I enquired specifically), but they sell more to Jockey in Asia than in India (Page).\n• Current Order book is 4-months of capacity. Better numbers are expected in the coming quarters.\n• Dividend policy – they explained that they have kept dividend at current levels keeping in mind their forthcoming Vietnam expansion, however , without making any promises, they did indicate that they are open to all options (including increasing dividend / declaring interim dividend) to reward shareholders at an appropriate time.\n• On related party transactions , they clarified that these are largely loans from promoters to take advantage of export opportunities, as raising money from banks would take time & speed is of essence. These loans are usually taken at a slightly lower rate than rate given to them by banks.\nMy conclusions :\nTo the layperson, like you & me, it would appear that there is little more to elastic than, well, elastic  …. To us it would seem to be a volumes & price game, and nothing more to it. Actually there does appear to be some more to it, and some differentiation , in terms of variety of products, quality, reliability , scale etc is possible.\nI feel that Premco Global management has pretty much mastered their niche, and understood their game.

I had looked at this company sometime back, and had invested small amounts (Due to a lack of complete conviction). Most of what I had researched has been covered beautifully here by posters. A few things, which I can add:\nDoes the company have pricing power?:\nIt certainly does, but : a) Not to a 1:1 extent b) With a time lag (I presume the contracts must be fixed for 3-6 months and renegotiated thereafter). Certainly shows reasonable bargaining power, which is critical when you are dealing with giants.\nIf you look at last 6 years, polyster (which forms more than 50% of RM costs) has increased at a CAGR of 10.5%, where realizations have only increased at a CAGR of 7.9%. Here is the data to back it up:\nSo whats driving margins and return ratios?:\nClearly, pricing power is not enough for increasing margins (realizations have increased at the same rate as raw material prices). So whats driving margins?\nFrom the above data, it seems that the company might be moving towards more efficient production. For example, for every lakh meter of elastic produced, the company was using 1.46 MT of polyster in FY09, a figure which came down to 1.11 MT in FY14. This implies either better machines being used, or lesser wastages due to better processes being implemented or a change in product mix\nOther expenses, including electricity and processing coming down. This clearly points to more efficient processes/machinery in place.\nBetter absorption of fixed charges like admin expenses due to higher sales turnover\nClearly, this has happened with a graduation of the next generation of management into the company (as has been established in this thread already). In textile business, management plays a more important role than most other businesses (Hence, you find most textile companies in the hands of families and less of professionalism). In this regards, I think its important to get some sense from the management on what processes/machines have been implemented to improve efficiencies in the production processes.\nThat was something I could not establish, and hence the lower conviction.','May 14, 2015 6:59 pm'),(3757,356,8,'Karan\nthe company is improving its product mix and improving its asset turns (improving cap. utilization) and focussing on exports more and more which is helping them across.\nWhat I am worried about is\nwhere is the capex for vietnam plant reflecting ?\nis it going to be a subsidiary of the company or not - the CS told me vaguely it will be folded in - but I have no conviction on it\nif not, where are they adding capex in india to ramp up\nthere is no commentary at all from the company and that makes this quite a black box.','May 14, 2015 7:22 pm'),(3758,356,594,'Great set of questions about the Vietnam Black box.

However, the additional point which I was trying to make was that better efficiencies/production processes seem to have played an equally important role towards better margins. Ultimately, realizations have kept pace with increase in RM prices over the last 6 years. However, whats changed is the usage of RM in terms of quantity indicating lesser wastage, better technology or a change in product mix. This, to my mind, should be more sustainable than most other factors (Trying to answer the question which @rohitbalakrish_ raised).\nAgain, this seems to be tying up with Mr. Lokesh Harjani coming in to manage the company (As @Vivek_6954 and @ayushmit have already pointed out). Actually, in a company like this, judging the promoter becomes very important; as suppliers to large branded garmenters are generally run by traditional families. Most other businesses have graduated to a more professional system, but spinning/weaving/processing remains concentrated in the hands of families. I have not seen any suppliers to garmenters/upstream players in the textile value chain who’ve seamlessly moved to a professional management (Except for Vardhman). Hence, in this case also, I think its important to try and judge the management, what they have been doing (Have read upgradation of machines in one of the reports, ties up with my theory) etc. True conviction will probably come only after that (Especially at the current PE levels ). Also, its because of these reasons (spinners/weavers/processors have very low bargaining power), and the importance of judging management, it is difficult to invest in spinning/weaving/processing companies (which do not have brands) with true conviction.','May 15, 2015 2:47 pm'),(3760,356,7,'Thanks Aveek.

It is not inconceivable that this facility would be almost fully dedicated towards all the Hanes’ requirements. In this worst case, there will be 50mn capacity in India which would be lying idle, unless PGL has already secured orders from others.

The standalone Profit After Tax of the Company Stood at Rs 985.79 Lakhs as against Rs1,265.82 Lakhs.\nThe earnings were lower mainly on account of Appreciation in Rupee, which appreciated more than 10% in Last quarter resulting in lower realization in Exports Revenue, and loss of Foreign Exchange Forward Premiums. The change in Government MIES benefits (Non-inclusion of Narrow Woven Fabric in MIES list uptil December 31st 2016), also resulted inlower Export Benefits accruing and affecting the profitability.\nSince, then the Company has re-worked on its FOREX Hedging Policy and the benefits under MIES scheme have been restored by the Government of India.

Atul is the only other Indian company licensed to produce phosgene. This is a moat for it. Other companies can’t just jump in to compete with them. Phosgene being a hazardous chemical/gas is heavily regulated. After trying for several years, Paushak received approval from the Ministry of Environment and\nthe Ministry of Industries for expansion of capacity from 150 tonnes per month to 400 tonnes per\nmonth. Paushak had applied for 5000 tonnes per year but received approval for 4800 tonnes. I understand that approval from Gujarat Pollution Control Board was awaited. I do not know the current status of this.\nIf you look at the March 14 results of Paushak, at BSE you will find substantial ‘Capital work in progress’. This reduced in September 14 and Capital assets went up correspondingly. This continues further in March 15 results and now only a small amount is ‘Capital work in progress’. This indicates that they have\ngradually added capacity. This is my inference and needs confirmation from the company.\nRight now, the results that you see (March 15 quarter annualized EPS is 52) is based on the 150 tonnes capacity. Once this expands to 400 tonnes per month, we can expect sales and profitability to improve. Paushak is debt free and their net profit margins have gone up substantially this year. They accounted for the entire CSR expenditure in the last quarter. Take that into account when you consider the profit growth.\nBased on the annualized EPS of March 15 quarter, the PE is less than 12 at the current price of 590. Considering that the profit margins are around 25% and we can expect better sales and profit margins from here onwards, post-expansion, I’m very optimistic about both; its earnings growth and the PE ratio that the market will give it.\nAnother factor I like about this company is its sound management. Chirayu Amin of Alembic group has the capability to build a large company from the ground up.

I have never invested in Granules but it has got nothing to do with the analysis shared by @andy161161 of Kee Koon Boon.\nIt is a note on Granules I prepared more than a year back and shared with few friends to decide if it’s investment worthy in Aug 2015 at about Rs. 120/- (appx) … (reproducing verbatim)\nMy take on Granules is …\nThey are focused on OTC and high volume, large market drug segment where their scale, efficiency and established track record with customers like Glaxo Smithkline (Panadol) and Mylan etc would give them clear benefit over long period of time.\nAuctus purchase is also to mine the API they (Auctus) has in large volume OTC segment.\nOmnichem JV is a front loaded investment bet. They expect revenue of Rs. 150 - 175 cr by 2020 with 25% margin … So, 50% would come to consol books. Nothing much to add in next 2 - 3 years as nowadays FDA approval etc have a much longer gestation period. I differ from India Nivesh here, they seem to be over optimistic.\nTheir new Gagilpur facility is extremely impressive … Tablet capacity is utilized only about 35% - 40% … Even though FDI approval has come but customer approval / customer disengagement from their previous contracts are still due. I don’t think it’s an easy task and also possibly they need to invest again for API facility to make FD.\nPFI is a word they invented … It is nothing but adding other non-active (excipients) substance to the API for making it consumption ready and next stage is Final Dosage (FD) preparation. Entire process is automated … Hardly 100 people in the shop floor in 2 plants (Gagilapur & Bonthapally). I am unable to figure out why they require 2000 employees … I am told most people are in loading / unloading / inspection / administration / housekeeping / FDA compliance / record keeping and purchasing.\nFixed asset break up is\nGagilpapur PFI and FD facility ---- Rs. 410 Cr.\nBonthapallu API facility ---- Rs. 45 Cr.\nGedimetla API and PFI facility — Rs. 120 Cr.\nBonthapally (II) Intermediary ---- Rs. 7 Cr.\nGranules USA Virginia ---- Rs. 25 Cr (the facility they purchased from Valiant Pharma)\nGranules China ---- Rs. 40 Cr.\nGranules Vizag — Rs. 20 Cr.\nComing 2 - 3 years they plan to invest heavily (as also mentioned in India Nivesh report) … But if you see past 5 years also, they invested heavily and Free Cash Flow got eaten by Fixed Asset Purchase … To me unlike other typical pharma company, Granules struggles to generate free cash flow in any real sense and their loan book is always growing. The largest plant in the world of Paracetamol at Bonthapally has only Rs. 45 Cr. gross block. So, it is the low margin, high volume, high asset turn money spinner for GIL. Here they seem to have no traction over pricing power or payment terms with their customers. But margin will improve when FD capacity utilization goes up.\nProblem with Auctus is their plant is FDA approved but the APIs are not … Unless they get these APIs approved, making use of the plant for US / Europe sales is difficult … They have to get API manufactured elsewhere and can use customer DMF to start manufacturing from Auctus facility which seems a farfetched idea for me. But they can continue to sell locally from Auctus facility (as you can see their domestic revenue growth last year was much higher than export growth)\nRelated party transaction — Large sales is done through US subsidiary and the receivable from them is also quite high (refer excel file attached) and it sales at no profit basis to capture market share by circumventing local distribution. I am not sure how much success can be possible … We need to see it unfolding…\nCorporate Guarantee of Rs. 120 Cr. given by GIL to Omnichem JV for the loan taken by the JV. They plan to share the guarantee 50:50 with Omnichem but not yet successful\nSubsidiary loan of Rs. 60 Cr. taken from banks at LIBOR + 400 … refinance being pursued at LIBOR + 150… It is not a intercompany loan.\nGranulles China makes no profit but company objective of having this set up is to ensure Raw Material supply and I think it’s OK.\nAuctus intangible of Rs. 88 cr. is depreciated over 45 years as per present book keeping … A minor but mentionable point!\nPromoters have other interest in Vineyard etc… Unlike most other pharma promoters http://krsmaestates.com/ 12\nOverall, It has entrenched position in what they do and can’t be dislodged. But the scope is almost constant. To get out of it, I think company is trying many things but it will take time for these to materialise… till date it is an investment led growth story… Going forward they can transform to a real pharma company but according to my understanding will take more time than the market is thinking. And this constant increase of related party sales / receivable and continuous increase in FA purchase is something I find hard to neglect.\nNot an investment worthy idea for me at present.

However, it also had ₹1.07b in cash, and so its net debt is ₹7.33b.\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Granules India had liabilities of ₹9.60b due within a year, and liabilities of ₹5.11b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of ₹1.07b and ₹7.83b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total ₹5.81b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.\nOf course, Granules India has a market capitalization of ₹31.4b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.\nIn order to size up a company’s debt relative to its earnings, its net debt is divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we get both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\nGranules India’s net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 suggests only moderate use of debt and its commanding EBIT of 23.9 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. In addition to that Granules India has boosted its EBIT by 73%, thus reducing the spectre of future debt repayments. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Granules India’s ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.\nA company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it’s worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Granules India saw substantial negative free cash flow, in total. While that may be a result of expenditure for growth, it does make the debt far more risky.\nBased on above Granules India is not finding it easy conversion of EBIT to free cash flow, but the other factors considered give us cause to be optimistic. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. Considering this range of data points, Granules India is in a good position to manage its debt levels.

Adding more colours from couple of other dimensions from earnings call, earnings presentation, results and past events\n1- There seem to be more deep-rooted involvement from the new generation promoter - Priyanka. She did answer many questions in the earnings call, and her answers gave confidence that she is detail oriented - articulated her views clearly on operations, business strategy and financials.\n2- 11% of topline came from GPI (US Subsidiary), and per comments from promoters this would get quadrupled in three years. Add to this that GPI focuses on high margin products (can see it in the earnings presentation). Putting both these points to together - the company is going to show higher profitability in near to medium term.\n3- ‘Granules is a manufacturing company in Pharma business’, Mr. Krishna Prasad has said this many times in the recent past. Let us go one level deeper to understand what it means. 85% of topline of Granules comes from 5 base products ( Paracetamol => Pain and fever control, Ibuprofen => Pain control, Metformin => Blood sugar control, Methacarbamol => Muscle relaxant, and Guaifenesin => Chest congestion control). These salts do not have a complex chemistry, and they are first defence medicines, and thus used in volume. In volume game optimal manufacturing processes through continuous improvement (Kaizen) is the game changer. Further, management explicitly said that they expect these five molecules would continue to contribute 3/4th of the topline over the next 3-4 years.\n4- Onco block => the Vizag (unit V) facility is called Onco facility but it contains multiple blocks; one of the blocks is used for Onco. The Onco block has started producing APIs. Granules is not going to have its own Onco drug, rather they will supply APIs to other players.\n5-Brownfield expansion of FD facility in Gagillapur => new block coming up with a multipurpose sustained release process. This process is used for complex molecules, so expect this to be ‘not’ used for five core molecules. The facility would be up in next 15-18 months. This should further give push to the margin.\n6- Capex, Cash to cash cycle, and cash flow => 400 crores of Capex this year and about 300 crores next year. All capex through internal accruals. Cash to cash cycle has been reducing consistently => better sweating of assets. Free Cash (Cash flow from operations minus capital expense) generated in this quarter was 37 crores, but should move up in Q2 and Q3.\n7- Would the demand sustain or we just saw a pent up demand in Q1? The management explicitly said that they expect the demand to sustain. It does make sense because (again) company does not derive major business from specialized drugs but from five first defence medicines.\n8- So what is Granules competitive advantage? It does seem their manufacturing process, backward integration giving cost advantage, and their deep rooted penetration in the market with their core five molecules. The management also seem to be walking the talk => reduced debt, free cash flow generation, buy back and pledge reduction, and transitioning the business from API to FD.\n9- What are main risks? Regulatory risks (FDA and other regulatory bodies), over-dependence on five simple molecules for most of the business, raw material (crude) price increase disrupts the profitability and dependence on China for one KSM (Key Starting Material) which is for their main product.\nIn the last three years Granules has doubled its topline, tripled its profit, reduced debt considerably, and become a free cash generating company. Can it repeat this performance for the next three years? I am not educated enough to even guess, but based on the little knowledge I possess, it does seem that there is fair possibility of repeat of this performance.\nCheers,\nKrishna\nPS: I know very little, and market had reminded/humbled me enough number of times.

The Capex was guided for next two years only (350 – 400 cr this year and 300 cr next year). As per concall remarks by Mr Chigurupati, they would match the capex to maintain the current growth rate. So, following are the estimates based on available information :-\nYear Revenue PAT PAT margin\nFY20 2599.0 335.0 12.89%\nFY21E 3118.8 405.4 13%\nFY22E 3898.5 506.8 13%\nAssumptions :\nGrowth 20% for FY21 and 25% for FY22\nPAT @ 13%\nSo, with PAT of 500 cr (FY22E), expected market cap at 20 times would 10,000 Cr\nCurrent market cap 6759 Cr. So it seems fairly valued at present.\nOne of the questions bothering me was the nature of its products – the base molecules (para, metf, ibu, metacarbo, guifen) are very basic / generic in nature and does not require any particular process / chemistry skills to manufacture them. This question was asked in the concall and Mr Chigurupati has answered that it is the vertical integration, unique way of manufacturing and regulatory compliance that has helped them constantly increase market share. As I understand, they play with their strength in manufacturing – high volume, low cost – translating into better economies of scale.

( BSE- 532725 ; NSE â SOLARINDS ) is one such company and straightaway we will start with its assessment without discussing further.\nCAGR of 79.22 % in Topline over the span of last 8 years is what is achieved by Solar Industries. If we look at just last five financial years, still, it has grown at a CAGR of 40.83 % and that too on a larger scale.\nThe most significant point to note here is that the CAGR of 40.83 % in topline over last 5 years has been achieved with a corresponding 26 % CAGR in actual volumes of products of the company which is a very healthy sign and signifies expanding marketplace as also increasing market-share of Solar in the segment.\nEBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 94.65 % over the span of last 8 fiscal years while if we take into account last 5 fiscal years, EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 55.82 %.\nPAT has grown at a CAGR of 94.99 % over the span of last 8 years and the same has grown at a CAGR of 58.69 % over the span of last 5 years.\nQuality of financials is healthy which is evident from the highest tax paid by the company in the industry ( at the rate of 35.5 % at PBT level and 30.36 % at EBITDA level ).\nEffective Management of such healthy growth is evident from the gradual reduction of interest payment as % to EBITDA which has come down to 8.56 % (FY11), consistent high RoE and RoCE over last 4 years which stands at 24.35 % and 25.56 % (FY11) respectively as also reasonable balancing of growth and shareholder payback by ploughing back higher amount of cash generated in the initial years and gradual reduction in ploughed back money with simultaneous increase in Dividend payment over last two years. This also depicts the justice done with minority shareholders which is otherwise rare in a high promoter holding (74.6 %) company as promoters could have enjoyed the high dividend payment by sacrificing growth which is not done by the management of Solar as a result of which the company today is on verge of an expoenential growth phase even on such higher scale.\nThe growth has also continued in Q1FY12 with a 49.9 % YoY rise in topline, 31.7 % YoY growth in EBITDA and 39 % YoY growth in PAT.\nThe management has consistently achieved growth with a conservative approach towards leverage which is evident from the reasonably healthy cash levels company maintains throughout the business cycle as also 50 % under-utilisation of bank limits granted to the company because of which its instruments command a healthy rating of P1+ and AA- from CRISIL.\nCompanty has a planned CAPEX of Rs. 200 cr. over next two years including the current year which management is confident of financing purely with internal accruals without much increase in debt as also without any significant equity dilution.\nWith the planned CAPEX, management is confident of achieveing 30 % annual growth in topline with improving EBITDA margins each year over next three years including FY12.\nNow, let\'s assess Solar Industries\' operational segment, its positioning in its operational segment as also future plans based on which management is confident of 30 % growth each year over coming 3 years.....Solar Industries operates in Explosives Industry which is dominated (domestic) by Orica (MNC), Gulf Oil, Indian Explosives and IBP in addition to Solar.\nSolar Industries dominates the market at No.1 position with an approximate overall share of 22 % in domestic market. If we look more deeply into the sub-segments of main operational segment, then, Solar is No.1 in Cartridge Explosives, Detonating Fuse and Cast Booster and No.2 in Bulk Explosives and Detonators.\nCompany has always remained ahead of its peers by proactive and efficient strategy execution like backward integration into raw material manufacture (except AN) and bulk purchase and trading of main raw material AN (Ammonium Nitrate) which has given it a high operational efficiency and highest EBITDA margins in the industry (only Orica which is MNC player in India enjoys such high EBITDA margins).\nThe operational segment enjoys high entry barriers like industrial license requirement, clearance requirement from Home Ministry and IB, etc. because of which there is least chance of much competition emerging in the segment. As far as growth and expansion of the market segment goes, it has a very bright prospect as each of the commodity like Cement, Steel as also Power indirectly require explosives. To elaborate, 1 MnT Cement requires 1.45 MnT Limestone while 1 MnT Limestone requires 166 MT Explosives; similarly, 1 MnT Steel requires 1.70 MnT Iron Ore while 1 MnT Iron Ore requires 200 MT Explosives; to add, Per Unit Thermal Power requires 0.74 Kgs Coal while 1.00 MnT Coal requires 1080 MT of Explosives. Hence, since domestic demand for Steel, Cement, Power and Coal is not expected to slowdown significantly in foreseeable future, demand for Explosives is set to show a growing trend in near future and exponential growth thereafter.\nCoal sector is atpresent the largest consumer of Explosives domestically with 70 % of that consumed by Coal India. Solar Industries is the largest supplier of explosives to Coal India and already 2011-12 tender of Coal India is through in which Solar has garnered a 8-10 % growth over last year. The contract is immune to price fluctuations in raw material with a quarterly cost-escalation clause.\nDerisked business model as well as proactive management quality is evident from the fact that Coal India which contrbuted more than 40 % to Solar Industries\' revenue 5 years before is today, as of FY11, contributing only 24.79 %.\nThe most significant point to take note of in the business strategy of Solar over last two years is its expansion into global marketplace and its robust growth there. Exports, which were insignificant before 3 years are today, as of FY11, contributing 13.53 %.\nThe growth in exports is likely to strengthen considerably in FY12 and FY13 as the current exports are on back of only one plant of the company being operational in Zambia (capacity â 10000 MT). Already in Q1FY12, another plant in Nigeria with similar capacity has become operational and is undergoing stabilisation and is expected to start production in Q2FY12. Construction on third plant at Turkey has commenced in the month of April 2011 and this plant in expected to start production in Q4FY12.\nFY13 will be the blockbuster year as far as exports of the company are concerned and coming 3 years are expected to see an exponential jump in exports of Solar.\nOn the domestic front, company is planning to almost double the present capacity of each of its existing product in coming two years to cater to the rising demand of mining and infrastructure sectors.\nSolar Industries also possesses a kind of Hidden Treasure in the form of its interest in two Coal Blocks, one located at Madanpur and another located at Bhatgaon. Madanpur Coal Block in which company has a 20 % interest is classified as \'No-Go\' area and a new application is made with MOFE for clearance of the same. As far as Bhatgaon Coal Block is concerned in which company has a 24.5 % share, all the formalities including Public Hearing is complete and Rehabilitation & Resettlement has been accepted. The company has already submitted revised mine closure plan and final clearance from MOFE is expected shortly after which land acquisition and development work will commence. The production from Bhatgaon block is expected to commence from FY14.\nIn our valuation matrix we have not incorporated any upside arising out of any of the Coal Blocks that company has interest in and have only valued upsides from the core business of the company.\nIn another significant development which is expected to boost already high profits margins of Solar further going forward, in Q1FY12, companty has got \'Mega Project\' status from the Government for its CAPEX at Nagpur. This status will entitle it to many tax benefits and management conservatively expects this development to add ~Rs. 10 cr. at PBT level in FY12 itself.\nAt current market price of Rs. 721, Solar Industries is available at a P/E of just 11.9 its FY12e earnings and at a mcap-to-sales of just 1.3 FY12e sales and at a P/E of just 9.6 and a mcap-to-sales of just 0.9 on FY13e numbers. A company with :\na RoE of 24.35 % ,\nwhich has consistently demonstrated high growth rates with healthy EBITDA margins over last many years,\nhas just started scratching off huge international market by setting up manufacturing plants overseas without burdening balance sheet or any form of equity dilution,\nhas also forward integrated by investment into coal blocks and,\nis also having a high promoter as well as institutional holding (combined comes to 89.97 %) and a low floating stock,\nshould actually command a scarcity premium and the whiff of the smallest positive trigger could start-off a rerating process for this company.\nPast Financials of Solar Industries\n( alongwith key expenses as % of sales/ebitda/pat to assess earnings quality as also Last 5 Years RoE & RoCE to assess management quality )\nFY11\nFY10\nFY09\nFY08\nFY07\nFY06\nFY05\nFY04\n(Fig. in ` cr.)\nRevenue\n722.85\n590.19\n530.37\n321.04\n237.65\n169.46\n135.29\n98.51\nEBITDA\n148.47\n111.99\n95.73\n71.01\n39.16\n36.7\n24.27\n17.32\nPAT\n75.59\n58.59\n44.13\n36.11\n19.21\n22.16\n14.99\n8.79\nDividend Declared\n80 %\n70 %\n45 %\n30 %\n15 %\n15 %\nNA\nNA\nDiv.Payout Ratio as % of PAT\n18.31 %\n20.68 %\n17.65 %\n14.34 %\n13.48 %\n11.68 %\nNA\nNA\nTaxes Paid\n(% of EBITDA)\n45.09\n(30.36 %)\n32.19\n(28.74 %)\n21.89\n(22.86 %)\n18.81\n(26.48 %)\n8.66\n(22.11 %)\n8.02\n(21.85 %)\n4.01\n(16.52 %)\nNA\nInterest Paid\n(% of EBITDA)\n12.75\n(8.58 %)\n13.35\n(11.92 %)\n23.48\n(24.52 %)\n10.55\n(14.85 %)\n7.16\n(18.28 %)\n3.3\n(8.99 %)\n2.38\n(9.8 %)\nNA\nRoNW\n(RoE)\n24.35 %\n22.43 %\n20.24 %\n19.61 %\n11.75 %\nNA\nNA\nNA\nRoCE\n25.56 %\n24.36 %\n22.14 %\n21.68 %\n13.19 %\nNA\nNA\nNA','Aug 9, 2011 4:28 pm'),(3996,362,1072,'At last I have found company apart from Tulsian !','Aug 9, 2011 8:18 pm'),(3997,362,344,'Hi Mahesh,\nThank you for the detailed report as always.

Excellent company in an excellent space.

(they had acquired distribution co. there so the sales don’t reflect only from nigeria)… In Zambia the potential market is huge as its the main mining area and new mines are being set-up there… At present they are doing there only 14 cr… Rgdg. FY12 they have indicated 40 cr. from Zambia, and 100 cr. from Nigeria. Rgdg. Tanzania they have not indicated anything…\nHow many years they may need to reach 80 to 85% of capacity utilisation at these places?\nIt depends on many factors, but it might take roughly 1.5-2 years…Also, its safe to assume that such high utilisation might not be feasible as explosives is a different business and depends on mining activities which itself depends on various factors like monsoons, etc.,\nWill they have same type of margins in those foreign countries also?\nNo… Margins are better, stable in upwards of 18 % + (they indicated till 20 % for zambia in FY12) as compared to domestic 17 % +. Also, here you need to understand one thing that margins will be much superior atleast for coming 2-3 years in Africa as there is least formidable competition there and Solar’s management was proactive and was right in judging the future potential and so will have first mover advantage… Orica, the main competitor of Solar in India has followed Solar’s footsteps and is now in the process of setting up 10000 MT plant in Zambia… For this plant it will take few years to come up but the plant of Solar in Zambia which started in 2010 is now fully stabilised and is ready to increase utilisation levels from this year , i.e. FY12.\nIf local demand does not grow, then it may be difficult for the exports to add to this local shortage?\nAgreed… But GV I can’t understand what you are thinking… Are we going to come to ground-level zero on infra space… Its impossible… Also, the thing which you are seeing in urban area, the picture is totally different in rural area… You just see there the construction projects going on… the infra initiatives of Gujarat & Bihar which are slowly reaching rural area… Here , I am not talking about just from the news items but with personal experience… I have one servant from a far away village to patna, now he doesn’t have to go via weak roads, perfect concrete road is in place and is getting constructed for reaching every villages, near his village a big power plant is being set-up, there is a labour shortage there and wages have shot up and so have his land prices… and this I am talking about just latest one month before experience when he came back from native place…Similarly, when I researched for PI and interacted with ground-level knowlege-bearing people of villages in Gujarat, a complete transformation is taking place and there are hoards of infra initiatives lined up…\nApart from these experiences, lets talk about figures… Coal industry which consumes 70 % of explosives, lets talk about it… India has the fourth largest coal reserves after US, Russia and China… India’s domestic demad for Coal is rising at the rate of 11 % p.a., India’s coal imports are likely to rise more than 50 % in 2011-12 while domestic production of coal which was forecast to grow by 7-8 %, is scaled down to grow at 3-4 % for 2011-12 becuase of delay in clearnces…Now, a country with 4th largest reserves has to suffice its almost 20 % domestic demand by inports, its highly unlikely…Govt. will step-up and issue clearances soon so that coal output can be increased…Even if it doesn’t, a 3-4 % rise in coal production (mining) could very well mean a 10 % growth for explosives industry, specifically Solar… and that is what management has indicated by garnering 8-10 % growth in coal india tender for 11-12.\nYou see, to look at other way round… India is the third largest Asian economy which is growing at 7-8 % and Coal accounts for more than half of the power generation of India… Hence, coal production has to go up which will hugely benefit explosives industry…\nNow, take the example of Steel, production of Steel has increased from 65 MTPA to 80 MTPA in 2010-11 and is forecast to touch 120 MTPA by 2012-13… This forecast is made just last week…Steel requires Iron Ore which in turn again requires explosives… To just clarify here, karnataka mining ban for iron ore should not hugely affect Solar as it doesn’t have operations there.\nNow, to come to Cement, India is the second largest Cement producing country whose production has increased to 315 MT from 300 MT this year… Out of the 137 large plants and 365 odd small cement plants that India has, only large plants themselves employ 1,20,000 people…Now, can a govt. afford slowdown here… a clear no… This is the reason why in a recently published report in which all the leading cement cos. were partcipants, they have forecast CAGR of 12 % for cement production in the period 2011-12 till 2013-14… Now, Cement requires limestone and limestone requires explosives…\nThe exact qty. of explosives required each for coal, limestone and iron ore are given in my research note…\nHence, what I want to say here is that domestic demand can’t die down completely and Solar is the only company from India which has shown reselience and has grown despite all odds by proactive strategy… 2008 meltdown also didn’t affect this co. which can be seen from the numbers posted by the co. since last many years and on first signs of slowdown in domestic demand co. ventured overseas to sustain the high growth rate achieved by the co…\nAny idea what would be the difference between cartridges and bulk explosives?\nBulk Explosives, as the name suggests, are high-grade explosives used for explosion in large open cast mines whereas Cartrdge Explosives are Small and Large diameter packaged explosives which are used for small open cast mines, underground mines and infra projects… Margins are better in later…\nSIL’s growth in future purely depends on Coal, Cement, Steel & Road sectors performance?\nYes… but not the performance but the core growth…\nWho are the major competitors? What prevents their customers from shifting to them?\nAs mentioned in my research note also… its Orica, Gulf, IBP, Keltech and Premier…\nFirst and foremost the growing market-size, capacities of Solar, quality of products as also reliability and ability to deliver which is crucial…\nAlso, here I think you have not focussed on details of my research note in which i have given positioning of Solar in each of the sub-segments of industry… will touch on it in your query no. 10.\nOther than licenses and regulatory approvals, is there any entry barriers for others to enter?\n)— Industrial License Required\n)— Home Ministry Clearnce Rqd.\n)— IB Clearance Rqd.

Is their contracts with them allow SIL to pass on the increase in prices?\nYes since last 2 years the contract provides for a quarterly revision in prices…\nWhile it used to be quoting more than 20 PE, but after 2008 crash, it has been quoting between 18.5 to 5.65 forward PE.

(which it has not atall intended and has infact increased exposure over last year), then also for that it needs liquidity or takers of the story… Now, on ground we have in these 4 years, the growth achieved by the co. for us to see as also 30 % p.a. growth guidance given by the company till FY14… The coal block investment is a plus and when it materialises it will be a added bonus… Hence, on the whiff of the smallest positive trigger, it could rerate significantly becuase of the same rangebound consolidation it has shown over last 2-3 years as such rerating is in best interest of promoters and Fis becuase of their 90 % stake in the co.\nOn a 30 % growth and EBITDA margins of 17 % + it has to trade at a reasonable forward 15 p/e at one point of time only based on its core business, which might come soon which reaches to around 910 for FY12 and 1126 for FY13… Any positive development on coal blocks will be an added bonus and if in FY13 the discounting of Bhatgaon coal block getting operational in FY13-end or FY14 is made then it could easily overshoot the target price…\nHaving said all these, I must admit here that PI and Solar form part of my core portfolio (Solar I have invested and is still adding) and so my views have to be taken with that regards… I have tried to be as genuine and as honest as possible in my replies but do your own due diligence before taking any call…\n**Thanks for sharing your views and keep sharing…\nRgds…**','Aug 12, 2011 3:11 pm'),(4006,362,667,'Link to Latest 12th August HDFC Sec.

He says all these would be from the internal accruals. Do they have so much of cashflow?\n**Yes… they can with a mix of debt and internal accruals… last fiscal they had already incurred CAPEX of around 95 cr. and managed it very well… They are just utilising 50 % of the bank limits they have and so they are getting very high rating from CRISIL… This year expected net has to be 100 cr. + … **\n)- They have already spent 97Cr on the two blocks.

The target was further lowered to 554 million tonnes. Coal output expanded at 7% a year during 2004-05 to 2009-10, but stagnated in the previous fiscal. In the past five years, demand grew at an average 8% and is expected to continue at the same rate during the next plan.\nCoal projects have struggled to get environment clearances since 2009, when the ministry’s no-go classification disallowed mining in 203 coal blocks. According to a coal ministry’s projection, the output from those 203 blocks, estimated at 660 million tonnes annually, could have been used to generate around 1.3 lakh megawatts of power a year.\n“The environment ministry had adopted the policy of \'go, no-go’a This would have severely impacted the ability to expand domestic production of coal,” said a commission official. \"The policy had to be reviewed and now some coal blocks have been cleared. This has to be continued to ensure coal availability.’’\nIn January 2010, the environment ministry imposed a temporary ban on development works, including some coal mining projects in Jharkhand and Chattisgarh in industry clusters identified under CEPI norms. CEPI is an index of 88 industrial clusters across India, ranked according to their impact on environment and was developed to plan developmental projects in tandem with environmental protection.\nThe commission said the CEPI norms had prohibited mining in areas with high pollution index even if pollution was because of some other industry. “Coal being location specific, there is clearly a need for review of this (CEPI norms) approach,” the paper notes. Currently the issue is under consideration of a group of ministers headed by _Finance Minister_ Pranab Mukherjee.\nThe commission estimates a significant rise in reliance on imported coal as it would not be possible to meet the increased demand from domestic sources. Coal imports are expected to rise to over 200 million tonnes from the current 90 million tonnes by the end of the 12th plan.\nThe increase in reliance on imports not only portends a significant increase of 30% to 50% in costs for power plants, it also necessitates expensive technological upgradation as the units are not designed to take more than 10-15% of imported coal at present.','Aug 27, 2011 12:59 pm'),(4011,362,667,'CCL to double output to 4 million tons per annum over three years\nAug 28, 2011 | PTI_mumbai_\nAt a time when mining companies are facing difficulties in land acquisition and getting clearances from the environment ministry, state-owned Central Coalfields (CCL) is planning to expand its operations to meet the increasing demand.\n‘Mini-ratna’ CCL, a subsidiary of the industry leader Coal India, plans to more than double its coal production to 4 million tons from the present 1.5 mt through underground mining over the next three years.\n“We plan to increase our production to 4 mt per annum from the present 1.5 mt through underground mining by 2013,” Central Coalfields Chairman and Managing Director R K Saha told PTI over the phone from Ranchi.\nThe company is slowly increasing its underground mining in a phased manner. “It is a challenging job, but CCL is handling very carefully,” Saha said.\nIt can be noted that strict environmental laws have put on hold many a coal and power project, apart from the iron ore mines and steel plants.\nA prominent example is the Rs. 51,000 crore Posco Steel project in Orissa which even after seven years remains on paper as the company has not been able to acquire the land for the project.\nThere are similar other mega projects, from Tata Steel to Vedanta and ArcelorMittal in Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand, which are pending for want of environmental clearances and lands.\nWhile the Posco project has a conditional green nod, it is stuck with land acquisition due to stiff opposition from the local population.\nThe previous environment minister Jayaram Ramesh had declared dozens of coal and iron ore mines as no-go areas, which had put the projects in a limbo.\nCCL recently received clearance from the Environment Ministry for its two open cast coal mines in Magadh and Amrapali. It targets to produce 20 mt per year in Magadh and 12 mt in Amrapali.\n“We have floated tenders for the two new open cast mining projects and are taking steps carefully to achieve the target,” he said, adding that company requires railhead closer to the two mines.\n“We have requested the government to complete the Tori-Hazaribag line early.

(They are following it so far and still have 44 cr left from IPO funds for store expansion)\nb) Key monitorables remain: Gross margins (currently around 30-32%, will help us check on massive discounts), Same store sales growth (has been around 10%, and going forward, mgmt has guided for around 10-15%), Sales per sq. ft (Rs.735 now), Working capital/Sales (currently at 82 days), average billing rate (currently Rs.400-Rs.500), shrinkage ratio (around 1%) and debt (long term+short term - there will be seasonality in short term debt due to nature of the business though)\nc)Have 2000 suppliers, and each supplier not exceeding 1% of sales. No plans to get into manufacturing (backward integration as Vishal Retail called it, before that bombed).\nd)Requires about Rs.2500-2600 per sq. ft capex to set up a store for the first time (Rs.1300 for the store, and Rs.1300 for inventory). So, 50 new stores for the next 2 years, on average of 8000 sq ft should come to Rs.100 cr (similar to what they have raised in IPO). Mgmt has guided that all further growth in stores will come from internal accruals only.\ne)It secures long term leases (9-10 yrs) with all the rental locations, and the termination would be at the discretion of V-mart. Biggest surprise is the rent per sq. ft over the past 5 years has hovered around Rs.28/-. That is, almost no inflation for 5 years in rent. This is combination of aggressively moving into tier 3 cities + mgmt’s negotiations\nf) From concall Q3 FY13 - “On same store sales growth - If you look at it for the age of 1-3 years, the Y-to-D same store sales growth is 19%; for the 3-5 years category it is 15% and > 5 years it is 8%. And this gives an overall aggregate of about 14%”\nSince most of the stores right now are in the 1-3 year category, we can expect good same store sales growth for the next 2-3 years.\ng) Current business mix -86% from fashion (apparel 75%, non-apparel 11%) and 14% from Kirana. No more kirana store addition. By logic, the % of kirana business should go down since more number of new fashion stores will be added (which should improve net margins)\nh) On average, they employ about 33 people per store\ni) From the AR (which is one of the best ARs I have ever read) -“At V-Mart, we expect that our business model will generate a 35-40% revenue growth and project to add about 25 stores in 2013-14, with a higher percentage growth in our post-tax bottomline, enhancing value in the hands of the shareholders”\nj) From the AR again (and similar sentences repeated in concalls) - “At V-Mart, we would rather grow 30% compounded across ten years supported by revenue growth in every single year as opposed to 50% compounded with three down years in ten.”\nk) Q4 FY13 concall, CFO - “On an average actually just to give you the seasonality in terms of numbersaI am talking basically about the bottom line. The bottom line in the first quarter is about 25%; in the fourth quarter at about 17% and the balance is accommodated between the second quarter and third quarter; the third quarter taking about 45% to 60% anywhere between that depending upon how the second quarter goes.”\nBased on my study and the direction given by the management (along with the stellar Q2 results), I am conservatively expecting an EPS of Rs.14-Rs.16 in FY14, if not more.

We are expanding into new territories. ‘Sourcing is the name of the game’ and Hemant (Lalit’s brother) is leading improving the sourcing initiative as much as possible.\nb) Deepak read out almost all numbers from the ppt (http://www.vmartretail.com/pdf/Review%20Q2 5’Mar’14.pdf)\nc) They ensure 24x7 power in all stores and they do this through diesel power backups. They have increased advertising to improve brand recall and investing quite a bit in employee training, contact programs for store managers etc. Due to these reasons, SG&A as a % of Sales has increased by a bit over last year.\nd) The management is targeting Tier 3 the most, as they see the growth rates from Tier 3 have been the highest (bang for the buck also).\ne) They are very clear that they would expand in district headquarters and want to encash any and every possible upswing in spending power - whether it be due to monsoon, elections, NREGA etc.\nf) The like-to-like growth (not sure what that means) in tier 2 and tier 3 was 10% and tier 1 was 8% (not sure if it was revenues/profits)\ng) They want to maintain EBITDA margins of 10% and above. In fact, Lalit did say that they want to ‘live and let live’ the ecosystem and he would be happy to be at 10%. If anything comes over and above that, he’ll take it.\nh) They are highly optimistic about a positive cash flow by end of the year\ni) **Important point:**There has been a -ve 38 cr in the cashflow statement due to working capital. Deepak explained that this was because of 3 reasons i) They planned their winter purchases better (they bought earlier than last year) and this accounts for 22-25 cr and ii) they were stocking inventory for new store openings (8-10 cr) and iii) They usually have 15-20% more inventory than Q1 in anticipation of the festive season\nj) Sales breakup typically is Q3 -> 30-35%, Q2 -> 20-25%, Q1 and Q2 about 25% each depending on how Q3 goes. (Profit breakup was given in Q3 concall, please see my post previously)\nk) The ideal sales per square feet per store is around Rs.800/-. They are around Rs.708/- for the half year.\nl) There was some impact due to UP riots, although can’t quantify. There was 10-15 days of disturbance. And then there were floods etc. Can’t quantify impact.\nm) Currently the breakup of product mix is 86:14 in apparel:kirana. They are planning to take it to 90:10 in about 2 years. Two reasons will contribute to this: i) All new stores will be fashion stores only ii) They have introduced a ‘space policy’ whereby they expect kirana space to reduce to incentives related to space policy.\nn) They are not looking at specific store addition count (although they are on track for 25 stores for this FY14 - which will take the number of stores to 94 by March 2014). What they look for is - ‘Can we grow the P&L by 30% CAGR’ and that defines their store addition. No aggressive plans as such. They look for best return on capital employed.\nThat was my summary notes. If I have missed out on any point, please do include.

I think the co. can make up any no. and present to shareholders,there’s no way to ascertain it,the growth in newly launched stores can make up for low growth/no growth/de-growth in more than 1 year old stores and vice-versa is also quite possible. Can it be right??\nAll I can say confidently is if sales/sq ft. is growing even after considering the store additions,the co. is doing good. If sales/sq ft. is same even after store additions,it’s a lame business requiring additional capital to grow additional even a bit.\n2). How does one come to know about dead stock?? Shrinkage only covers loss of inventory,what about stock that doesn’t get sold. All the retailers say that their profit margins on every unit sold is in the range of 50-100% but that doesn’t reflect on overall basis since all the units don’t get sold. How does one come to know about it??\nTook some position in V-Mart after initial write-up,trying to know retail in depth.','Oct 31, 2013 10:52 am'),(4094,367,328,'Hi Nikhil,\na) There is no good way to track/cross-check the same store sales growth - it’s totally upto to the point whether you trust the management or not. It’s almost like, if Tata Steel says they have sold x tons of steel, there is no good way to verify whether it was x tons or x - 10000 tons.\nEventually, it should get reflected in the cashflow statement. Sales per sq ft can only go up by so much - right now it’s around Rs.700/- and the mgmt indicated that the ideal is Rs.800/- per sq ft (unless, they start moving into higher price point apparel). So, tracking only this to determine a good/lame business may not be very prudent.\nb) The only good way to track is inventory turnover/days. If the inventory days are deteriorating (and you can compare V-mart’s trend to a Pantaloon/Shoppers stop) over the last 3-4 years, then there is a lot of dead stock left over. Usually, dead stock is churned by good managements through prudent markdowns (heavy/light). Right now, inventory days is about 82. If it deteriorates to say 100-110, then you have a lot of dead stock. If it reduces (as is the case with the V-mart over the last 3-4 years), then there is little dead stock.

Grant Thornton is the auditor\n2. E&Y has been appointed internal auditor\n3. Westbridge Capital (one of the most respected and best track record PE investors) has invested in the business\n4. Excellent disclosure standards regarding the financial performance\n5. Management âWalk the talkâ over the last 10 quarters\nRegarding stock audits, the Company has increased its coverage from 12 stores to 30 stores, and in my view we will see more store coverage in this quarter and going forward.

Many investors over-react to one worth of same store sales results, and the reason might be bad weather or an overly difficult comparison to the prior year period. If we can focus on the fundamentals of the business and keep an eye on the key metrics highlighted above, the stock may be available at a reasonable price. Concerns raised regarding the IMHO the management team has been extremely transparent with regard to the financials and fundamental performance. I have personally not seen such high levels of disclosure in a retail business, having done significant work in this space. Management has completely in terms of growth in number of stores and growth trajectory, and have been cautious with regard to store openings. Proof of this has been the fact that they have shut down only 3 stores in FY11, 1 in FY12, 1 in FY13, 3 in FY14. I would like to highlight below some key parameters that show the business performance over quarters. It needs to be remembered here that during this phase we were undergoing a slowdown in economy and other players were barely making profits. There is some seasonality as exhibited in the numbers below, with skewed performance in Q3 due to the festival season (Diwali, Christmas, New Years and marriages) Number of outlets | 93 Total area | 7.49 Average area per outlet | | | | | | | | | Same store sales growth | | | | | | | | | Sales per square feet | 42.15 Conversion rate | 65% Transaction size | 601 Average selling price | 90% Kirana Contribution | | | | | | | | | Inventory (105 days in Dec 11) | 1.5% Regarding manpower costs, it is to be noted that the manpower costs are a function of store openings and cannot be taken as the total number of stores multiplied by number of employees per store and salary. If this information is broken down into quarters, we get the following which is consistent with the annual report Manpower (30 employees per store) | 2790 Per head Costs (INR 10000 per month) | 1.2 Total manpower costs | 837 Total costs (in cr) | 8 Annual manpower costs (as calculated, excluding head office employee costs) costs in Annual report (inc head office employee | Here I would give the management benefit of the doubt, given the disclosure standards they follow. Even the above calculated numbers are not correct because some stores may just be operational for a couple of days in a quarter. So I would not be too worried about numbers not being accurate but as mentioned would focus on the same store sales growth, inventory and debt levels. Some comforting factors for me include Grant Thornton is the auditor E&Y has been appointed internal auditor Westbridge Capital (one of the most respected and best track record PE investors) has invested in the business Excellent disclosure standards regarding the financial performance over the last 10 quarters Regarding stock audits, the Company has increased its coverage from 12 stores to 30 stores, and in my view we will see more store coverage in this quarter and going forward. The Company has been focusing on best practices, and plugging loopholes in its systems and processes. It does not seem to me that the Company has been trying to manage margins by underreporting shrinkages, but this is something that needs to be tracked going forward. Previous quarters have seen the Company adopt best management audit practices of rent equalisation, depreciation as per New Companies Act, amongst others which has resulted in lower margins. So the Company seems proactive in terms of adopting these methods and not focusing on short term results. Overall, I would be cautious about the valuations at the current levels, but this seems like a Lynch-like \"growth stock\", which due to the execution capability the management could provide disproportionate returns in the future. Disclosure : I am invested in the Company from lower levels, and am bullish on growth prospects [/quote]\nDear Naman,\nIt was a very detailed analysis and I am quite impressed.\nThe manpower cost analysis is perfect taking into account the quarter wise sales. I had this Doubt while doing the calculation , but I didn\'t have the quarter wise store opening numbers at that point of time . Though there are some elements of costs such as supervisory manpower at the store and the staff welfare - both together might add to another 15% to costs. But still the numbers are ok.\nI still have concern on the basic moat of the business I.e lowest cost retailer in that location. How are they the lowest cost retailer in each location? They are located in the centre of the town ( not outside like a Walmart ) and hence have a higher cost of rent than the local retailer ( in view of long term agreement, rent payments in white , better location , larger size etc.), higher costs of manpower since local retailer will have informal staffing of family members , elations etc, higher costs of power , security and communication as compared to a local retailer. Yes, They have lower cost as compared to a Trent or big bazaar , but they are not competing against Trent or big bazaar .\nNow with respect to bargaining power in products that they sell which can lead to lower purchase costs - 100 stores is not large enough a scale as compared to wholesale markets from which a local retailer buys.\nFor example, local retailer in Allahabad or Meerut or Bahraich or any other tier 3/ tier 4 town in UP would buy either from the aminabad market in Lucknow or laxminagar or Karolbagh Market in Delhi which are large wholesale markets. Now Merchants in these markets have far higher bargaining power as compared to V Mart with a manufacturer. For example, a wholesale shop in Laxminagar or Karolbagh market in Delhi caters to at least a few hundred retailers from all parts of the country on a daily basis. From my understanding , v mart also do partial buying from whole sale markets.\nConversely, v-mart get lots of private label manufacturing done. In this case, risk of unsold stock is that of v-mart since they will have to purchase equivalent stocks of a production batch size as compared to buying only on the basis of demand in wholesale markets.\nThe point that I am making is that the supply chain in India is far more cost effective and the scale needed for an organised retailers to effectively compete against a local store in not in multiples of 100 stores , but in multiples of 1000 stores. That is the reason why you find that organised retailers like big bazaar and Trent are still not consistently providing high ROCE like Market leaders in other industries.\nComing back to V mart ,if their cost of buying is lesser than that of local competition and they are pricing the products as per the market , then their margins should be significantly higher than the current 30% . In case , their prices are lower than the market and hence there is excessive demand, same store growth should be much higher than 8% growth they are currently getting. 8% same store growth is ok but not a great growth indicating a strong moat.\nOne discomfort I have is that the v- marts do not get the kind of footfalls which big bazaar stores used to get when they started in mid 2000\'s . From a customer perspective , you don\'t see the wow factor . They have similar merchandise with similar prices as that of local market, better locations , larger size and air conditioned stores. Is this enough of a moat in retail business ? I am not convinced .\nNow comparing v-mart to Walmart - Walmart had differentiated themselves through lower price, larger assortment , out of the town locations and low cost ingrained in the organisational culture Making them the lowest cost player , better people practices leading to better customer service etc. When they started 70 years back in USA.( Refer \" Made in America \" by Sam Walton )\nOnce they became a brand , some of those differentiators got diluted but the low cost remained since they continued out of the town locations and added global sourcing from cheapest cost centres around the world . What are the differentiators in v-mart which will make them another Walmart in making ?\nI would love to be proved wrong so that I can invest in this stock.\nRisk monitored\nâ1.\n2.\n3. â\n4.\n5.

The AR itself states -\nThe Companyâs motto of âPrice-less Fashionâ promises contemporary products and services at reasonable prices to upwardly mobile Indians in non-metro Indian locations.\nI would hazard a guess that its products are slightly more expensive with the perception of ‘better quality’ than whats being sold at existing retailers.','Oct 21, 2014 9:53 am'),(4114,367,691,'Hmmm, interesting points raised by Naman and Seshukumar.\nLet me add a perspective of Gurgaon where I was based for 11 years from 1998-2009. From 2004-05 onward malls started springing up all over Gurgaon, like mushrooms. And within 3-4 years, several shops of well known brands within the malls started folding up and the malls started resembling ghost-towns. A shop keeper I met, nailed the logic perfectly: people come to malls to see the goods in air-conditioned comfort. Then they go to Lajpat nagar or Karol Bagh, or Sarojini Market and purchase the short-listed goods at lower prices from there.\nThis is typical Indian value-seeker behavior.\nWhy is the population of towns where V Mart has its stores, not behaving in a similar fashion? Can V Mart undercut the local shops? Can V Mart offer fashion garments, the local shops can’t?\nI would like to here views about this. Thanks in advance.','Oct 21, 2014 12:46 pm'),(4115,367,280,'The key point to consider here is what V-Mart is providing a service to customers that allures them to continue buying from them. Consider a small town, say Bhagalpur (where I was born), where people do not have much source of entertainment and shopping experience is limited. These smaller towns have anywhere between 5 lakh a 20 lakh people (kids, men, women, elder), and each of them have aspirations and desires for a better life. They look towards the bigger cities where there are brands like Benetton, Nike, Adidas, Zara etc (none of which want to come to smaller towns due to the economics).\nAnd then a 8000 square feet V-Mart store opens up in their neighbourhood, which delights everyone and they can go there anytime to shop for every special occasion and regular purchases of apparel. As long as they are offered a good experience with good quality clothes at a reasonable price, they will continue to shop there (of course till another competitor steps in reallocating the profit pool). This afeel gooda experience cannot be offered by local retailers, where the nature of shopping is largely transactional.\nI think people in cities also want to get this experience of buying good quality clothes at a reasonable price, with a feel good experience of visiting a mall. We go to the malls very often to get this experience when we could get the same clothes at factory outlets or even local retailers.\nThe fact that people love this experience is exhibited from the sales numbers that we are seeing from V-Mart stores. Sales per square feet of 800 Rs per square feet per month from these smaller cities is something that retailers in bigger cities would be delighted to have. Shoppers Stop has sales of ~650 a 700 psf, Future Lifestyle of ~511 psf and Future Retail of 745 psf. This clearly demonstrates that the shopper is not only visiting for the air conditioner and the ambience, which certainly happens.\nAnother interesting fact is that they have conversions of 65% - 70% of the shoppers, which clearly means that the aspiring minds of consumers gets them to buy the apparel, even if they have come for wandering in the retail area. With an increasing footfall, rising average sales price that would result in higher sales going forward.\nHigh spsf along with lower rentals of 30 rs psf makes V-Mart extremely efficient on operating costs. Shoppers Stop pays 50 a 55 Rs psf, Future retail 40 Rs psf, and Future Lifestyle pays 55 Rs psf, Pantaloons = 15% of sales is rent, Trent = 12% of sales (largely due to high rentals in metros and Tier 1 cities). This has allowed V-Mart to increase margins from 6% to 9% when other retailers have been squeezed off their margins (see post above)\nHowever, I do agree that local retailers will continue to co-exist along with stores like V-Mart (just like kirana outlets continue to thrive even with Easyday, More, Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh taking large retail spaces), but there are significant advantages that V-Mart has compared to local retailers and organized retailers, which I am summarizing below a\nExperience a Covered in detail above.\na. This is of significant importance in small towns, and more importantly because no organized retailer has been able to setup their infrastructure in Tier 2/ Tier 3 cities, nor have I heard of any focus of these players on Tier 2/ Tier 3 cities (Biyani being too busy with Food Park & Big Bazaar; Aditya Birla getting Pantaloon and More in order; Reliance focusing on large formats Fresh, Digital, international brands, Tata expanding Westside, Tesco, Zara etc)\nb. It is not that companies have not tried setting up such infrastructure in smaller cities in the past. An example is Tata owned Trent had tried retailing fashion apparel in Tier 3 cities through stores called- Fashion Yatra - started in 2008, but failed and closed the business in 2012 (10000 square feet stores with prices between 150 - 750 similar to V-Mart)\nFocus on Fashion a Realizing quickly that kirana does not offer good margins and is a drag on the business, the management has brought down the % of kirana to 10%. This gives immense confidence in management being able to quickly take decisions for the business. In contrast, large businesses find it extremely tough to make such big decisions and continue to fund losses a this is evident from Shoppers Stop funding Hypercity (even after consistent losses), Trent funding Side Bazaar etc etc\n**3). **Lowest cost operator\na. Compared to Walmart, V-Mart has similar costs. In fact V-Mart gross margins are higher at 29% compared to 25% for Walmart. If you consider the operating costs, both Companies have limited their costs to 20% of sales, which is quite incredible considering that other retail players in India operate at 30%+ operating costs (See my post above)\nb. Compared to local retailers, there would be a significant cost advantage with regard to sourcing and as you said, the sourcing advantages would become bigger as V-Mart scales, though they are already operating at 29% gross margins. I have looked at various franchise agreements for apparel brands, and they give only 20 a 35% margins to the local franchisee partner. The franchise partner will then have to manage the cost of rent, employees, power, security, advertising, promotions/ discounts etc in that cost.\nc. This cost management would ensure that V-Mart would be able to sustain competition in different parts of the country it plans to expand to\nPlanned and cautious expansion a V-Mart has chosen to expand based on a cluster based strategy, whereby each store is 150 km apart from each other to manage supply chain efficiently.\na. This is incredible as the management has learnt from mistakes made by Pantaloon, Subhiksha, Vishal Megamart who in their quest for topline growth opened stores in all parts of the countryawith warehouses and hence loosing complete control over costsaresulting in high inventory a higher debts and subsequently shutting down of business.\nb. Take a look here http://www.vmart.co.in/store%20map.html 4\nc. Now see this…does this remind you of something J http://projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/ 5 (Sourced from Kiranas post above)aAnd NO I am not suggesting V-Mart is the next Walmart J\nd. Also as discussed above, store closures have been limited in the last 4 years. Compare that to 50 stores shut by Aditya Birla More, 50 stores by Reliance Retail and Biyani selling Pantaloon to Aditya Birla a showing management credibility in being able to better manage the business compared to the big players\n**5). ****Sourcing & Procurement a **This is a key aspect of their business which helps them provide the latest fashion at affordable prices. It is important to highlight here how the sourcing works\n**a. **Company has tied up with over 2000 registered vendors across the country where each product is sourced for the best economic value and quality. They get the woolen from Ludhiana, denims from Delhi region, plastics from Daman, kidswear from Kolkata and hosiery from Tiruppur.\n**b. **It is impossible for a local retailer to setup this level of sourcing, or for that matter a new organized player will take significant time and investment to setup such a supply chain\nc. Given the Companyas localisation strategy this helps them significantly\nd. As they scale this sourcing capability can be used to their advantage by dictating favourable terms and pricing to the vendors\nGrowth a IMHO, if a retail business can provide 8% same store sales growth it is doing extremely well, especially in the consumer markets we have witnessed in the last couple of years. This 8% SSSG, along with opening 25 a 30 stores would yield growth of atleast 30% to the topline, which could imply atleast a 30 a 40% growth in EPS (assuming all other things remaining constant, and economies of scale spreading the central costs over a larger number of stores).\nIt may not be an apples to apples comparison between Big Bazaar in its early days with V-Mart because of the following\nBig Bazaar outlets were 25000 square feet in size compared to V-Mart size of 8000 square feet (At the time of Big Bazaar IPO in 2005 they had 21 outlets, with average area of 45000 square feet)\nBig Bazaar offered kirana vis–vis fashion apparel for V-Mart\nBig Bazaar operated in big cities (with first stores in Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad), vs V-Mart in Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities\nToday Big Bazaar has sales per square feet of INR 750 Rs as compared to INR 795 for V-Mart (even though Big Bazaaras most stores are in Tier 1 cities)\n**Return on Capital Employed a **This consistent growth along with an 18% - 20% ROCE that the Company has been able to achieve speaks highly of the management being able to manage the business well over the tough economic period when other businesses were struggling.\nThe above provides a reasonably good idea of how V-Mart has positioned itself as being a cautious fast growing business, with excellent (and difficult/ time taking to replicate) supply chain and procurement strategy, low cost operator with a distinctive positioning for the consumers (providing fashion apparel at a reasonable price to aspiring middle class Tier 2 & Tier 3 customers).\nHappy to answer any further questions you may have.','Oct 21, 2014 1:10 pm'),(4116,367,732,'Hi Naman,\nIn terms of business model, target market, and value proposition, do you consider V2 retail comparable to V-mart?

Initially we started working with wholesalers only from the south and now we have strong networks with many wholesale sellers in Delhi, Calcutta, Surat & Mumbai. Apart from my family experience in retail stores, I have worked part-time in a major retail store in Chennai (to fund my engineering  ) and during my MBA my team did a project on inventory management for a major retail store. (This is just to give a back-ground).\nCustomer’s wow factor towards large mall style stores (similar to 8k squareft V-Mart stores): The wow factor is definitely there and whenever a large format apparel store is opened a lot of sales move from un-organized to organized stores. It is like the customer has a different experience when he/she walks in, and at-least to experience the buying experience. -> This is partly the reason why you see V-Mart’s sales with every new store goes up significantly.\nRepeat customers is very very important for an apparel store. Why? If customer derives value, in tier III towns a lot of publicity is word of mouth. Trust plays a key factor here. A new store will have a lot of first time customers, where as same store sales growth will give you some insights on repeat customers. It is easy to buy sales by opening a new store, but it is very difficult to retain and grow the sales because.\nInventory Management: Any retail store that manages inventory well will do amazingly well in business. Why? Assume a retailer typically purchases for Rs. 100. Lets say he marks up the goods by 30%(the actual mark-up is actually way higher in kids segment). Typically he will be able to sell 75%(not a guess, it is by experience) of the goods without any problem. With this 75%, he typically pays off the wholesaler and the remaining inventory is his profit.\na. One must go deep to understand how V-Mart manages inventory. If it is a family managed business, the owner will know how to carefully ensure the older ones get out of the shop. Are the employees trained to such a detailed level? We have had good interactions where our employees go and work for these large retail format stores, and they say typically there is no such emphasis on that.\nb. In a new store, most of the goods are new and usually the conversion from footfall to sales will be easy. But the older the store becomes, quite possibly you will have a lot of unsold inventory, the conversion becomes difficult. Same store sales growth will give you some hints on this.\nEmployee Cost: The typical employee cost in an unorganized family owned store(in my town) is 4.5k. In a large format store it is around Rs. 6000 for a tier III town. I have read somewhere that a very popular store in T Nagar in Chennai pays around 8k for its employees. So the number of 10k/month for an employee could be a higher estimate.\nShrinkage : The shrinkage numbers reported by the company is a very normal problem. In tier III towns there is usually a lot of theft by employees, or some rogue customers. It will be a very difficult problem to control. One should factor in a minimum of 50 to 100 bps for this.\nFamily run business is a Cost leader: In many posts there were comments about V-Mart having a cost advantage. But a family owned store has zero debt, mostly own stores(so no rental), relationships with suppliers for a very long term, Low employee cost( he himself is an employee  & 100% devotion to one store which you can’t expect from a store manager). So the differentiator here is shopping experience.\nIn apparel retail industry, there are a lot of un-controllables. That is the reason many large format retail stores are finding it difficult. I have just tried to list out a few below:\nConstantly changing designs – If not managed, inventory piles up, lower sales, it would lead to vicious cycle.\nShrinkage – This is a major problem\nEmployee attrition (common problem)\nThere is a lot more I could add, in terms of how the whole value chain works. I was just trying to point out the challenges that V-Mart could face. A long term investor should understand V-Mart’s approach to each one of these problems. India is a complex market.

And what does the management need to do for that? And is the management indeed doing that?\nI think the obvious way is to increase same store sales growth (as increases sales without any extra investments / hardly any need for extra cash needed) from the current 10% to 15% or so… This will generate a lot of extra cash profits… But then that is easier said that done…\nOther way is to increase gross margins - however this is also constant @30% for FY12, FY13, FY14 despite more than doubling of sales… Aren’t they able to purchase cheaper when purchasing in bulk, and thus increase gross margins? Arent they able to optimize their supply chain costs? Isn’t scale helping with margins?\nTheir is only so much that can be done to reduce operating expenses, considering it is already one of the lowest in industry in terms of operating expenses…\nSo, what is the game? Keep raising fresh capital to fund growth, keeping the business dynamics (margins, same store sales growth) unchanged? Until a point where all the new stores along with existing stores generate enough cash internally to fund growth?\nI would have liked to see the management working on improving business dynamics (gross margins and/or same store sales growth) by taking advantage of scale/learning curve… Then the management can be considered a great management, and not just a good management…\nThe risk in the current way of thinking is - what if gross margins fall by a couple of percentage?

(current city population = 2 lakh).\nMy store is approximately 8200 sq ft and it does psft sale of Rs 6200 (approximately).\nComparison with above discussion -\nStore size\n8000 sqft is nothing much, at least in western Maharashtra. You will find at least one store of 8000+, 4 store of 5000+ and least 10 store greater than 2000 in many cities, with population less than 3 lakh.\nSSG rate\nAs already pointed by someone in above earlier post, inflation is around 6 - 8%. So even with almost same quantity sold, you will get sales increase automatically.\nDead stock\nThis is biggest problem in any apparel shop.\nSmaller or single store like us, pay very close attention (almost weekly). We usually purchase as and when needed, instead of buying everything before start of season.\nBut even after this, most of us are stuck with dead stock of 10%+\nFor organized retailer, buying process usually start 6 months before product arrive at store. In this process, there is far greater chance of products becoming out of fashion.\nAdvantages of geographical spread / bulk buying -\nThis is difficult to achieve in apparel retail.\nReason being with every 100km, choice changes.\nEg in western Maharashtra, white and sober taste are most preferred. While if one move towards south, karnataka, dark color are more preferred. If one go towards north, Gujarat, fancy work is more preferred.\nAlso, each caste / religion has their own taste / preference in apparel.\nEg. Hindu / muslim and jain / marwari needs very different types of sarees.\nSo even if a retailer has stores spread across India, he has little advantages of bulk buying.\nThis is beautifully explained by Kishor Biyani in his book. Refer to white shirt example.\nCompetition -\nThere are low entry barrier to start apparel store and competition is intense.\nIn late 4 Years, at least 15 new shops (Avg sqft 1000+) has opened in my city.\nThen there is also competition from branded segment.\nRaymond, Peter England ( i own this one), Cotton King has opened franchise in my city.\nMan power cost -\nThis is biggest issue for me. Apparel is still seasonal business.\nYou just can’t hire new salesperson and fire him once season is over. This is because you need to give training to sell apparel.\nCurrently i spend 5% of my sales on apparel and Avg cost per employee per month is approximately 8000 - 12000.\nIt is very serious problem and organized retailer do face problem on this front.\nOther Overhead -\nOther overhead like electricity bill, municipal taxation remain same but organized retailer needs to pay rent while most of shop owners have their own property.\nDistribution network -\nSince fashion keeps changing and customer always want something different from what he has seen last time, it pays to buy from wholesaler, rather than manufacturer.\nThere are few items for which we do buy from manufacturer ( we go to banaras, Ahmedabad, surat, panipat, Amritsar, Indore, Jabalpur, Erode, Madurai and many other places)\nBut at the same time, we buy more than 50% of our entire purchase from wholesale market ( MUMBAI, Indore, Amravati, gandhinagar).\nEvery apparel retailer knows wholesale is least 10 - 12% costly than manufacturer but they also know that it far easy to buy than sell.\nSo even if organized retailer has edge of direct buying from manufacturers, it doesn’t make much difference.\nOpening store in smaller towns -\nI don’t precisely know why big retailer (shoppers stop / reliance) don’t open store at small cities but my guess is -\nLocal Retail market is too small\nTheir overhead are higher, so they need bigger sales to justify overhead\nStrategy (L&T construction division has strategy of not bidding any project below 500 Cr)\nSo strategy of opening in smaller towns has is no moat or doesn’t give much distinct advantage. IMO\nReducing FMCG / kirana -\nAgain this is not unique.\nFuture group is already doing this. I have visited few newly opened big Bazaar where first 2 floor were given to apparel / fashion and last floor was given to FMCG.\nEven i remember, one of our visiting professor from future group used to tell that we have decided FMCG won’t grow beyond 25% of our sales. We are using it mostly to attract foot falls.\nDisclaimer - I have not visited any v-mart yet but have visited and shopped at other organized retailer numerous times.

The current antidumping duties are applicable till July 2019. In this slide it is stated that the contribution increase in FY 2014-15 was largely on account of imposition of Anti-dumping duties which favorably impacted EBIDTA by 4%. So if at all if you are looking at a worst case scenario where the antidumping duty is reduced or suspended or gets removed, you can see a worst case of 4% but internationally from experience we have observed that as and when the antidumping duty gets suspended the CIF prices from the exporting country goes up. Even in some of our inputs, where ADD is in place or modified or revised downwards, the CIF prices gets adjusted suitably. Further considering the expansion plans, on a larger volume base, we are of the view that these impacts will be insignificant.\nhttp://www.nocil.com/images/fckeditor/file/NOCIL_Earnings_Call_FY18_Transcript.pdf 18','Nov 24, 2018 7:51 pm'),(4171,368,167,'http://www.dgtr.gov.in/sites/default/files/RC.NCVdona.final-english.pdf 63\nI recommend everyone to read Pages 23-31 in this which gives a good idea of where Nocil (replace Domestic Industry with Nocil in these pages) stands. I found lot of interesting observations by the DG here.\nAlso, as an investment, if Nocil is currently at 100% capacity utilisation and it takes time for new capacities to run full steam, in the near term, both the ADD overhang and higher fixed costs of running additional capacities at suboptimal utilisations should adversely hurt margins in the coming quarters.

Compare to last financial year.\nMarket Outlook\nCustomers are investing confidently and substantially in growth of their capacities. The global and investments are investing in building up tyre capacities to the extent of Rs.55,000 Cr which should fructify over the next one or two years. This is globally happening across the tyre segments of truck tyres, passenger car tyres, off the road tyres, etc. In India also there are few e major multinational companies, who are also investing and expanding their Indian operations.\nDomestic tyre industry will grow between 12-14 %. For next 4-5 years. In line there are major r domestic players announcing their expansion plans over the last 12 to 18 months of about 12,000-15,000 Cr.\nDue to recent disruption in supply from China due to pollution issue result in supply disruption to many of the major rubber chemical consumers including the large tyre companies. In this situation company had steady supplies to regular customers both in domestic as well as domestic market at reasonable price levels keeping in mind a long-term view of the business. This has generated a lot of goodwill for the company and it has deepened relationship with customers, which auger well for long term business.\nChina will be the major suppliers of rubber chemicals to the world but their pricing will increase due to the investments made by the Chinese Players and competitors in pollution control coupled with a strict surveillance so this will reduce the price differential that company was facing earlier.\nOn 3-4 % growth for rubber consumption globally will generate additional new demand of 40,000 metric tons of rubber chemicals globally per annum.

How will company scale up its business ?\nThere are two issues\nIt depend on how the trade tensions between US and China pans out.\nCurrently the duty structure proposed by US is implemented in two phases from September 2018, rubber chemicals were attracting 10%, and from January 2019 it is going to be increased by another 15%.\nOn world market\n35 % of business comes from exports only.\nThe investments made by company customers like Bridgestone, Michelin, Yokohama rubber company is part of it. Company is already there with approvals and with existing relationships it is very easy for company to participate in these new company which is happening.\nThe second part of it is the trade war between China and US. China is company major competitor and as of now rubber chemicals had been slapped on an additional 10% import duty by the US authorities effective September 24th. There will be another additional 15% duties coming on rubber chemicals starting January 1st, now which means the China who is a largest exporter of rubber chemicals in the world would find it increasingly difficult to hold their position in the US market. Company existing customers like Sumitomo Rubber , Yokohama Rubber opening the gates for NOCIL to supply to the US-based plants, which opportunities were not there earlier\nOut of total 450 Cr of CAPEX from which 900 Cr revenue will be generated how much of it is export ?\nIt depend on time of availability of raw material but focus will be to maximise domestic market business which has a value addition much better in terms of the duty structure. But company have already earmarked something for exports, The exports percentage of turnover which is about less than 30% in the long run will go up because the global market is much higher than India. India has only 5%-7% of the world market, so 93-95% of the global market. So company have to export which will lead to increase the export percentage.\nAs the duty structuring favourable to company does that will change post the ADD goes off ?\nNo company is talking about Indian duty structure which is about 10 % , 7.5 plus other charges is 10% higher. So the value addition per se even if the ADD is not there, in the local market is much higher as compared to exports – because the exports has Nil duty\nWhat will be the impact of ADD going off ?\nIt will be 4 % on EBITDA margin assuming that duty is in place till July next year and company is in discussion for application of an extension of the same. It should be depend on the merits of the case.\nIs there any significant change in terms of basket of raw material availability plus price increase which can impact company margin ?\nThere is no price increase in the quarter in fact there is softening of raw material prices.\nIn EBITDA percentage of 30 % how it is difficult for other chemical manufacturer, other countries to establish some more capacity and compete because this looks to be very lucrative business ?\nIt is lucrative if one see from outward only. But one has to look at the parameters of the business in terms of technology, technology developments, the approvals of the product from the customer , so one has to look at all these parameters.\nWhat led other companies to stop to enter into business ?\nGlobally about 80 % of this business is was controlled by three large international players. Most of them have now become shut, one has gone out totally, the second one is the mere shadow, they are only in one product in stead of about 15 products that they were in earlier. And the third one is there but have not shown any growth or anything like that because business goes through cycles and the business was not looking good. They lost interest. Maybe they lost patience. But it is very, very unlikely that there would be any capacity additions or any significant capacity additions in the western world or the development world, okay. There have not been any over the last five years or 10 years, any new additions.\nFor new players the gestation period for this business is rather high, for tyre company approvals, it will not take less than two years and is very difficult to dislodge an existing player. So there is inbuilt kind of deterrents to new players wanting to come into this business.\nIf there is demand in global market, did company will increase volume in high double digit number ?\nCompany is not looking at international market because India is a growth market and the first three or four customers all of them have plans individually of about 3,000 or Rs. 4,000 Cr investments over the next two years and on that market company have nothing to do additional , their requirements grow up and which is very natural that the biggest largest, most reliable, one of the oldest suppliers will get a reasonably good chunk out of that business.\nInternationally company have about 2.5 decades worth of relationship with the top three, four, five, six companies in the tyre business and company will be intend to take advantages of that with additional capacities.\nCompany have evaluated the financial feasibility or the project feasibility on an assumption of three years to ramp up 100% utilization. Company endeavour is always to occupy or utilize the capacity much earlier. It depends on how the market pans out, but there are some movements in the market or actions in the market place which can temporarily distort this momentum.\nWhat is the status now of China realigning their capacities and is there a case where these margins sustain through all incrementally from here?\nThere are two things to look on\nCompetitors like China Sunshine, Yanggu Huatai, Kemai Chemical, all these companies have invested substantially in their environmental CAPEX or pollution effluent treatment CAPEX with no major incremental additional production aspect. Now for example one of the competitor had to wait for permission from those pollution control authorities for almost a year or year and a half for getting the product on the commercial stream. So company have not t heard any major CAPEX being announced, one may not be surprised because they are currently in the process of rectifying all those noncompliance issues into a compliant zone.\nThere are some small capacity players who cannot be named individually but aggregating significantly, those capacities are more or less vanished or they are in the process of shutting down.\nDoes the antidumping duty placed on China by US place an opportunity for company but on the other hand it might also free up some capacities for China, does it have any bearing or any impact incrementally on the margins by any chance?\nif a player is operating on the global basis and one market for whatever reasons trade war or other things kind of closes down opportunities in that market they would certainly look at other markets. Company is competing with China from last 15-20 years so company is confident of defending our position against the Chinese players both in the domestic market as well as the international market. The other thing a lot of that aggregation has been taken care, do not forgot that if they have to sell into the India, they are dealing with Rs.74 to a dollar today. Their production cost have gone up. The labour cost in china is also not cheap. So China edge of doing business is largely blunted. There would be an efforts to place larger quantities in to India.\nHow is the average selling price moving because in this quarter, there might be exchange gains also, because there is softness in the cost side. So kindly give some sense on how the next two quarters company is seeing the average selling price of the rubber chemicals?\nTo begin with there is softening of some input cost on account of the petrochemicals downside on certain products, amines and solvents. As a result, as a dutiful supplier company have e also passed on those benefits to the customer in the form reduction in prices. More important is company is able to manage the EBITDA percentage.\nHow much company is selling in US right now and how much china is selling in US and how this will play out in coming time ?\nUS and the western world accounts for almost 22% of the world market, India is only 5%-7% of the world market. US as a country do not have major produces, so they have to import. Either a producer from EU to supply or from other market including China. Company have a relationship multinational tyre companies, who have plans in US also. More important is to have a relationship. There have been enquiry form few multinational companies to supply to US.\nIn US if one has to impose antidumping duties or countervailing duties or any such additional duties on a trade partner, there is a two-month period of consultation which has gone through with the industry before the duties come in play. The first tranche of duties came in place on September 24. Two months before that or even more than that, the intentions were pretty clear. Normally it will take 1-1.5 year sustained effort to open up for new location for doing business with company international tyre companies. In the last three month company have at least two major tyre companies figuring in the top seven or top eight global tyre companies opening up the US plans to us for supply which have already started.\nHow much of revenue come from speciality products and where company would be having fairly high level of pricing power and completely fairly ?\nThe specialty business is not value added product it includes specialized application as well. It accounts for 25% of the total revenue. And the regular business or the regular products of rubber chemicals which is the traditional one accounts for 75% and typically the volume value also more or less in the same percentage\nDoes the customers who are looking to increase supplier from India are they coming for long term supplier. Because if China increase the supply then does that customer will go back to China ?\nIt is very difficult in tyre business to keep shifting and shuffling the supply chain. it is difficult to get into a tyre company as a supplier, will take time one and a half to two years for approvals and to start business. By the same token, it is very difficult for them to throw out a supplier, if the supply chain equations change in favor of somebody else. It does not happen overnight because remember rubber chemicals is only about a few percentage, 3 or 4% of a tyre, but they are very critical to performance. There have been changes in the past where millions of tyres had to be taken back. And those kinds of examples have destroyed large tyre companies, so no one takes that risk. So the new opportunity which company is getting is long term.\nMargin in the business is 30 % so it is very high in respect to the fact that they had sent to general chemical segment so in next couple of years competitors will come so does company have plan any diversification ?\nCompany have opportunities to consolidate position n in the rubber chemical business some more before company get into o the diversification and as far as the margin percentage is concerned or the EBITDA percentage is concerned,\nIn dahej plant there is a combination of several initiatives, e. One is the technological improvement. Second is the shift in the export parameters from regular products to specialty products, component of the specialty being higher in export business, then there have been some optimization in the utility aspects maybe setting up a in-house turbine, then there is some anti dumping duty. It is a combination of several factors which has enabled company to achieve those parameters.\nBetween value addition and EBITDA company is able to see the traditional 31% has already come down to 27 % and this will shrink further.\nIs there any diversity even at R&D stage as of now or there is anything at the R&D stage also as of now?\nThere are some products and company is working on it and there are also some samples.\nDid company get any benefit of rupee depreciation in the quarter ?\nThe sales are rupee denominated but the prices are negotiated based on import parity. For a user in India company can buy domestic and can import. The import is going to cost right where the exchange rates comes into play and that is kind of parity that domestic players will seek.\nWith new capacities coming up and selling more in US and Europe did company have to go for a recognition process of two to two and a half year again or is it already there?\nCompany have existing relationship and it is just a expansion of new plant and they had already started to buy raw material from company.\nWhen company will ramp up its plant in the export market than the value addition will be about 10 % lower than India ?\nYes\nWhat percentage of company capacity is planning for export from the new capacity ?\nToday it is 28-30 % toward export and in long run company will increase it on overall basis. It depends on how market pans out and how many expansion plans are coming of the tyre industry, how many additional volumes are going to get regenerated out of India. As a rule this 30 % export mix will definitely go up.\nHow will the new 74,000 capacity will ramped up to full utilization given the new American market also opening up.\nThe project of Navi Mumbai has been commissioned , the technical or the production team has been able to generate a 100% utilization on the plant capability perceptive. On the marketing side company have already placed 50 % of the incremental volumes in the market place, may be in the coming quarters, company will start consolidating further and to ramp that. As far as the Dahej plan is concerned, once the production comes, the samples are approved by customers, then the utilization will start.\nOn client engagement side , if company is supplying to one client in India and same client put another plant in Europe than how much time company need for approval ?\nThere are no issues on specifications as they are known and approved . The companies were interested to use company products in Europe plant It was a matter of sorting out what kind of packaging is needed for the European plant because the packaging and the handling systems can be different in India and in Europe.\nTo what extent is the cost higher of China product compare to company product made in India ?\nLabour cost for a chemical industry is 8 % , 7% or so . It is major chunk of the cost.\nProduction cost in China are not unstable. It is a moving target, it keeps moving very largely depending on energy cost, raw material cost, other cost, fixed cost, environmental cost. Impact of cost depend on the specific rubber chemical because some are more environmentally damaging and some are less damaging, but has a very rough number, the environmental cost could be anywhere between USD 0.30 to USD 0.50 per kg.\nDid the negative 8.8 Cr below PBT is toward M2M loses ?\nIt is a fair valuation method as per the IND-AS accounting standards.\nWhat is the current capacity and on what level of utilisation company is working on ?\nBeginning of the year company was about 55,000 tons production capacities and utilization was 97 to 100% depending on the product to product and the demand. Company is planning to expand almost double over the next one year thereabout. So by September 2019 or thereabout company should must double the production capacities.\nIn which other segment did these chemical can be used and how is the marketing shaping for company ?\nIn speciality chemical it includes specialized applications where it has specialty there in antioxidants something in accelerators and something in Zinc-based applications also. Each product has its own market. So it includes tyre industry. It includes non-tyre industry, Latex industry etc. Some pharma also is there\nCompany efforts is to use it in tyre, belting, footwear, condoms, hoses or gloves, these are the industries that company supply.\nWhat kind of inflation company expect in employee expenses ?\nCompany work on principle of about 10 %.\nIn the new plant the employee cost will reduce because revenue will be far more than the employee cost.\nWhat is the product pricing difference between company and China product ?\nBoth have the same quality and they had seen disruption from china from almost a year so they don’t want to depend on China so they are diversifying and it China is charging 3.1 $ for a product than company can charge 3.4 $ and they are happy to give it.\nWhy promoter has sold its stake ?\nIn 2016 when there was promoter split there Navin was holding about 38 lakh shares at the time split. They have already sold 30 lakhs, 8 lakhs still there and that has already come under the non promoter category in terms of after the SEBI approval or the stock exchange approval. Insofar as the Mafatlal industries are concerned, their broad approved a total quantum of 16 lakh shares spread over from May 2018 to May 2019 that is 12 months. Out of that they have sold about 2.5 lakhs or 3 lakhs and that is needed for their business growth. It is an independent board. MIL is an independent broad. NOCIL is an independent broad. So these are in the broad, has taken a decision and they are not going to exceed 16 lakhs.\nLast quarter the crude price has shot up so did company see the full impact of raw material cost prices or company have long term stock for suppliers ?\nIn case of raw materials these are benzene derivatives, and company had a softening scenario. So company experienced a fall in raw material prices. beginning July or thereabout and it is still continuing. So as a result, company don’t experienced any major untoward in terms of raw material procurement.\nThe impact is more depend on the individual demand for the particular chemical and does not diversify follow the trends that crude is showing. So as a result when crude has gone up in the last few months for specific raw material company has see a drop at the moment.','Nov 29, 2018 7:27 pm'),(4173,368,606,'Motilal initiated coverage on Nocil.\nNocil-Motilal.pdf 135 (908.7 KB)\nThough nothing new in report that has not been discussed in this thread.

The current antidumping duties are applicable till July 2019. In this slide it is stated that the contribution increase in FY 2014-15 was largely on account of imposition of Anti-dumping duties which favorably impacted EBIDTA by 4%. So if at all if you are looking at a worst case scenario where the antidumping duty is reduced or suspended or gets removed, you can see a worst case of 4% but internationally from experience we have observed that as and when the antidumping duty gets suspended the CIF prices from the exporting country goes up. Even in some of our inputs, where ADD is in place or modified or revised downwards, the CIF prices gets adjusted suitably. Further considering the expansion plans, on a larger volume base, we are of the view that these impacts will be insignificant.\nhttp://www.nocil.com/images/fckeditor/file/NOCIL_Earnings_Call_FY18_Transcript.pdf 18','May 4, 2018 7:52 pm'),(4200,368,147,'Nocil Ltd\nHighlights of Q2 FY19 and H1 FY19 Results\nProjects\nIn Navi Mumbai Part, the first phase of the project has been commissioned and within three months the plant delivered full capacity ans such plant take 12 month to stabilize.\nDahej Plant will be commissioned during the quarter and sample of finish products will be given to customer in Q4 of financial year.\nBusiness is expected to grow about 10 % in volumes during the financial year. Compare to last financial year.\nMarket Outlook\nCustomers are investing confidently and substantially in growth of their capacities. The global and investments are investing in building up tyre capacities to the extent of Rs.55,000 Cr which should fructify over the next one or two years. This is globally happening across the tyre segments of truck tyres, passenger car tyres, off the road tyres, etc. In India also there are few e major multinational companies, who are also investing and expanding their Indian operations.\nDomestic tyre industry will grow between 12-14 %. For next 4-5 years. In line there are major r domestic players announcing their expansion plans over the last 12 to 18 months of about 12,000-15,000 Cr.\nDue to recent disruption in supply from China due to pollution issue result in supply disruption to many of the major rubber chemical consumers including the large tyre companies. In this situation company had steady supplies to regular customers both in domestic as well as domestic market at reasonable price levels keeping in mind a long-term view of the business. This has generated a lot of goodwill for the company and it has deepened relationship with customers, which auger well for long term business.\nChina will be the major suppliers of rubber chemicals to the world but their pricing will increase due to the investments made by the Chinese Players and competitors in pollution control coupled with a strict surveillance so this will reduce the price differential that company was facing earlier.\nOn 3-4 % growth for rubber consumption globally will generate additional new demand of 40,000 metric tons of rubber chemicals globally per annum.

How will company scale up its business ?\nThere are two issues\nIt depend on how the trade tensions between US and China pans out.\nCurrently the duty structure proposed by US is implemented in two phases from September 2018, rubber chemicals were attracting 10%, and from January 2019 it is going to be increased by another 15%.\nOn world market\n35 % of business comes from exports only.\nThe investments made by company customers like Bridgestone, Michelin, Yokohama rubber company is part of it. Company is already there with approvals and with existing relationships it is very easy for company to participate in these new company which is happening.\nThe second part of it is the trade war between China and US. China is company major competitor and as of now rubber chemicals had been slapped on an additional 10% import duty by the US authorities effective September 24th. There will be another additional 15% duties coming on rubber chemicals starting January 1st, now which means the China who is a largest exporter of rubber chemicals in the world would find it increasingly difficult to hold their position in the US market. Company existing customers like Sumitomo Rubber , Yokohama Rubber opening the gates for NOCIL to supply to the US-based plants, which opportunities were not there earlier\nOut of total 450 Cr of CAPEX from which 900 Cr revenue will be generated how much of it is export ?\nIt depend on time of availability of raw material but focus will be to maximise domestic market business which has a value addition much better in terms of the duty structure. But company have already earmarked something for exports, The exports percentage of turnover which is about less than 30% in the long run will go up because the global market is much higher than India. India has only 5%-7% of the world market, so 93-95% of the global market. So company have to export which will lead to increase the export percentage.\nAs the duty structuring favourable to company does that will change post the ADD goes off ?\nNo company is talking about Indian duty structure which is about 10 % , 7.5 plus other charges is 10% higher. So the value addition per se even if the ADD is not there, in the local market is much higher as compared to exports – because the exports has Nil duty\nWhat will be the impact of ADD going off ?\nIt will be 4 % on EBITDA margin assuming that duty is in place till July next year and company is in discussion for application of an extension of the same. It should be depend on the merits of the case.\nIs there any significant change in terms of basket of raw material availability plus price increase which can impact company margin ?\nThere is no price increase in the quarter in fact there is softening of raw material prices.\nIn EBITDA percentage of 30 % how it is difficult for other chemical manufacturer, other countries to establish some more capacity and compete because this looks to be very lucrative business ?\nIt is lucrative if one see from outward only. But one has to look at the parameters of the business in terms of technology, technology developments, the approvals of the product from the customer , so one has to look at all these parameters.\nWhat led other companies to stop to enter into business ?\nGlobally about 80 % of this business is was controlled by three large international players. Most of them have now become shut, one has gone out totally, the second one is the mere shadow, they are only in one product in stead of about 15 products that they were in earlier. And the third one is there but have not shown any growth or anything like that because business goes through cycles and the business was not looking good. They lost interest. Maybe they lost patience. But it is very, very unlikely that there would be any capacity additions or any significant capacity additions in the western world or the development world, okay. There have not been any over the last five years or 10 years, any new additions.\nFor new players the gestation period for this business is rather high, for tyre company approvals, it will not take less than two years and is very difficult to dislodge an existing player. So there is inbuilt kind of deterrents to new players wanting to come into this business.\nIf there is demand in global market, did company will increase volume in high double digit number ?\nCompany is not looking at international market because India is a growth market and the first three or four customers all of them have plans individually of about 3,000 or Rs. 4,000 Cr investments over the next two years and on that market company have nothing to do additional , their requirements grow up and which is very natural that the biggest largest, most reliable, one of the oldest suppliers will get a reasonably good chunk out of that business.\nInternationally company have about 2.5 decades worth of relationship with the top three, four, five, six companies in the tyre business and company will be intend to take advantages of that with additional capacities.\nCompany have evaluated the financial feasibility or the project feasibility on an assumption of three years to ramp up 100% utilization. Company endeavour is always to occupy or utilize the capacity much earlier. It depends on how the market pans out, but there are some movements in the market or actions in the market place which can temporarily distort this momentum.\nWhat is the status now of China realigning their capacities and is there a case where these margins sustain through all incrementally from here?\nThere are two things to look on\nCompetitors like China Sunshine, Yanggu Huatai, Kemai Chemical, all these companies have invested substantially in their environmental CAPEX or pollution effluent treatment CAPEX with no major incremental additional production aspect. Now for example one of the competitor had to wait for permission from those pollution control authorities for almost a year or year and a half for getting the product on the commercial stream. So company have not t heard any major CAPEX being announced, one may not be surprised because they are currently in the process of rectifying all those noncompliance issues into a compliant zone.\nThere are some small capacity players who cannot be named individually but aggregating significantly, those capacities are more or less vanished or they are in the process of shutting down.\nDoes the antidumping duty placed on China by US place an opportunity for company but on the other hand it might also free up some capacities for China, does it have any bearing or any impact incrementally on the margins by any chance?\nif a player is operating on the global basis and one market for whatever reasons trade war or other things kind of closes down opportunities in that market they would certainly look at other markets. Company is competing with China from last 15-20 years so company is confident of defending our position against the Chinese players both in the domestic market as well as the international market. The other thing a lot of that aggregation has been taken care, do not forgot that if they have to sell into the India, they are dealing with Rs.74 to a dollar today. Their production cost have gone up. The labour cost in china is also not cheap. So China edge of doing business is largely blunted. There would be an efforts to place larger quantities in to India.\nHow is the average selling price moving because in this quarter, there might be exchange gains also, because there is softness in the cost side. So kindly give some sense on how the next two quarters company is seeing the average selling price of the rubber chemicals?\nTo begin with there is softening of some input cost on account of the petrochemicals downside on certain products, amines and solvents. As a result, as a dutiful supplier company have e also passed on those benefits to the customer in the form reduction in prices. More important is company is able to manage the EBITDA percentage.\nHow much company is selling in US right now and how much china is selling in US and how this will play out in coming time ?\nUS and the western world accounts for almost 22% of the world market, India is only 5%-7% of the world market. US as a country do not have major produces, so they have to import. Either a producer from EU to supply or from other market including China. Company have a relationship multinational tyre companies, who have plans in US also. More important is to have a relationship. There have been enquiry form few multinational companies to supply to US.\nIn US if one has to impose antidumping duties or countervailing duties or any such additional duties on a trade partner, there is a two-month period of consultation which has gone through with the industry before the duties come in play. The first tranche of duties came in place on September 24. Two months before that or even more than that, the intentions were pretty clear. Normally it will take 1-1.5 year sustained effort to open up for new location for doing business with company international tyre companies. In the last three month company have at least two major tyre companies figuring in the top seven or top eight global tyre companies opening up the US plans to us for supply which have already started.\nHow much of revenue come from speciality products and where company would be having fairly high level of pricing power and completely fairly ?\nThe specialty business is not value added product it includes specialized application as well. It accounts for 25% of the total revenue. And the regular business or the regular products of rubber chemicals which is the traditional one accounts for 75% and typically the volume value also more or less in the same percentage\nDoes the customers who are looking to increase supplier from India are they coming for long term supplier. Because if China increase the supply then does that customer will go back to China ?\nIt is very difficult in tyre business to keep shifting and shuffling the supply chain. it is difficult to get into a tyre company as a supplier, will take time one and a half to two years for approvals and to start business. By the same token, it is very difficult for them to throw out a supplier, if the supply chain equations change in favor of somebody else. It does not happen overnight because remember rubber chemicals is only about a few percentage, 3 or 4% of a tyre, but they are very critical to performance. There have been changes in the past where millions of tyres had to be taken back. And those kinds of examples have destroyed large tyre companies, so no one takes that risk. So the new opportunity which company is getting is long term.\nMargin in the business is 30 % so it is very high in respect to the fact that they had sent to general chemical segment so in next couple of years competitors will come so does company have plan any diversification ?\nCompany have opportunities to consolidate position n in the rubber chemical business some more before company get into o the diversification and as far as the margin percentage is concerned or the EBITDA percentage is concerned,\nIn dahej plant there is a combination of several initiatives, e. One is the technological improvement. Second is the shift in the export parameters from regular products to specialty products, component of the specialty being higher in export business, then there have been some optimization in the utility aspects maybe setting up a in-house turbine, then there is some anti dumping duty. It is a combination of several factors which has enabled company to achieve those parameters.\nBetween value addition and EBITDA company is able to see the traditional 31% has already come down to 27 % and this will shrink further.\nIs there any diversity even at R&D stage as of now or there is anything at the R&D stage also as of now?\nThere are some products and company is working on it and there are also some samples.\nDid company get any benefit of rupee depreciation in the quarter ?\nThe sales are rupee denominated but the prices are negotiated based on import parity. For a user in India company can buy domestic and can import. The import is going to cost right where the exchange rates comes into play and that is kind of parity that domestic players will seek.\nWith new capacities coming up and selling more in US and Europe did company have to go for a recognition process of two to two and a half year again or is it already there?\nCompany have existing relationship and it is just a expansion of new plant and they had already started to buy raw material from company.\nWhen company will ramp up its plant in the export market than the value addition will be about 10 % lower than India ?\nYes\nWhat percentage of company capacity is planning for export from the new capacity ?\nToday it is 28-30 % toward export and in long run company will increase it on overall basis. It depends on how market pans out and how many expansion plans are coming of the tyre industry, how many additional volumes are going to get regenerated out of India. As a rule this 30 % export mix will definitely go up.\nHow will the new 74,000 capacity will ramped up to full utilization given the new American market also opening up.\nThe project of Navi Mumbai has been commissioned , the technical or the production team has been able to generate a 100% utilization on the plant capability perceptive. On the marketing side company have already placed 50 % of the incremental volumes in the market place, may be in the coming quarters, company will start consolidating further and to ramp that. As far as the Dahej plan is concerned, once the production comes, the samples are approved by customers, then the utilization will start.\nOn client engagement side , if company is supplying to one client in India and same client put another plant in Europe than how much time company need for approval ?\nThere are no issues on specifications as they are known and approved . The companies were interested to use company products in Europe plant It was a matter of sorting out what kind of packaging is needed for the European plant because the packaging and the handling systems can be different in India and in Europe.\nTo what extent is the cost higher of China product compare to company product made in India ?\nLabour cost for a chemical industry is 8 % , 7% or so . It is major chunk of the cost.\nProduction cost in China are not unstable. It is a moving target, it keeps moving very largely depending on energy cost, raw material cost, other cost, fixed cost, environmental cost. Impact of cost depend on the specific rubber chemical because some are more environmentally damaging and some are less damaging, but has a very rough number, the environmental cost could be anywhere between USD 0.30 to USD 0.50 per kg.\nDid the negative 8.8 Cr below PBT is toward M2M loses ?\nIt is a fair valuation method as per the IND-AS accounting standards.\nWhat is the current capacity and on what level of utilisation company is working on ?\nBeginning of the year company was about 55,000 tons production capacities and utilization was 97 to 100% depending on the product to product and the demand. Company is planning to expand almost double over the next one year thereabout. So by September 2019 or thereabout company should must double the production capacities.\nIn which other segment did these chemical can be used and how is the marketing shaping for company ?\nIn speciality chemical it includes specialized applications where it has specialty there in antioxidants something in accelerators and something in Zinc-based applications also. Each product has its own market. So it includes tyre industry. It includes non-tyre industry, Latex industry etc. Some pharma also is there\nCompany efforts is to use it in tyre, belting, footwear, condoms, hoses or gloves, these are the industries that company supply.\nWhat kind of inflation company expect in employee expenses ?\nCompany work on principle of about 10 %.\nIn the new plant the employee cost will reduce because revenue will be far more than the employee cost.\nWhat is the product pricing difference between company and China product ?\nBoth have the same quality and they had seen disruption from china from almost a year so they don’t want to depend on China so they are diversifying and it China is charging 3.1 $ for a product than company can charge 3.4 $ and they are happy to give it.\nWhy promoter has sold its stake ?\nIn 2016 when there was promoter split there Navin was holding about 38 lakh shares at the time split. They have already sold 30 lakhs, 8 lakhs still there and that has already come under the non promoter category in terms of after the SEBI approval or the stock exchange approval. Insofar as the Mafatlal industries are concerned, their broad approved a total quantum of 16 lakh shares spread over from May 2018 to May 2019 that is 12 months. Out of that they have sold about 2.5 lakhs or 3 lakhs and that is needed for their business growth. It is an independent board. MIL is an independent broad. NOCIL is an independent broad. So these are in the broad, has taken a decision and they are not going to exceed 16 lakhs.\nLast quarter the crude price has shot up so did company see the full impact of raw material cost prices or company have long term stock for suppliers ?\nIn case of raw materials these are benzene derivatives, and company had a softening scenario. So company experienced a fall in raw material prices. beginning July or thereabout and it is still continuing. So as a result, company don’t experienced any major untoward in terms of raw material procurement.\nThe impact is more depend on the individual demand for the particular chemical and does not diversify follow the trends that crude is showing. So as a result when crude has gone up in the last few months for specific raw material company has see a drop at the moment.','May 4, 2018 7:52 pm'),(4201,368,136,'Path laid for tyre makers to have a smooth ride; This could be positive for Nocil 214','May 4, 2018 7:52 pm'),(4202,368,313,'How is the Management of Nocil Ltd if anyone can guide on that ?','May 4, 2018 7:52 pm'),(4203,368,1123,'NOCIL 3Q FY19 Investor Presentation 135','May 4, 2018 7:52 pm'),(4204,368,297,'Anyone attended todays concall','May 4, 2018 7:52 pm'),(4205,368,1124,'Co. shows no debt on the balance sheet and yet the credit rating report shows ‘facilities’ of 200cr.\nCan someone help me understand this?','May 4, 2018 7:52 pm'),(4206,368,1125,'The facility breakup indicates that most of it is indirect limits which will not appear on the balance sheet.

Earlier today a friend called me to ask if I was interested in the Parag Milk IPO and I was surprised since it was the first I heard about this.\nThe reason I’m posting here (and the reason for my friend’s call) is because I had a passing association with the company about 5-6 years ago. While I was never employed or received any compensation there, my colleagues and I provided informal assistance to the team that was implementing SAP software there (the primary vendor was IBM) and have visited their Manchar plant and interacted with middle management on a few occassions. I also have some experience in the dairy industry from having implemented SAP at another mid-size dairy which competes with Parag in milk (but not in by-products).\nIt’s been a while since I visited the site, but from what I remember Parag seemed to be a very professionally run organization that believed in the value of technology. Their infrastructure is among the best in India and I would rate it second only to Amul (I visited their Anand plant and had the privilege of meeting Dr. Kurien many years ago).\nSome other thoughts on the topic that come to mind (no particular order)\nThe dairy industry (especially in Maharashtra) is quite regulated - The procurement price of milk from farmers is tightly regulated. The prices are revised only about every 6 months or so. Even with the government-specified price, the amount paid to the farmer depends on the quality of milk (the quality of milk is determined primarily by two parameters - Fat %age and Solid Non-Fat (SNF) %age. The government publishes a price table for the various combination of Fat & SNF in the farmer’s batch of milk. i.e. x% Fat & y% SNF = Rs. A/liter, while x% fat & z% SNF = Rs. B/liter and so on).\nThe quantity of the raw milk is also variable - cows and buffalos produce more milk in milder/colder weather than in the summers.\nSimilarly the quality of the milk (Fat & SNF) also drastically varies by season.\nPackaged milk has to meet certain minimum standards of fat & SNF before it can be sold to customers. Due to the seasonal variation in milk quality, sometimes perfectly good & hygenic milk cannot be sold because it does not meet these standards. I was informed by someone in the industry (not someone at Parag) that this is not because of a problem in the raw milk or processing, but because the standards were derived from those set in the Netherlands where such climatic variations are less (1). Some dairies resort to purchasing skimmed milk powder in bulk and mixing it with the milk to be sold to increase the fat content (2). ** Note: I make no claims to the factualness of points (1) and (2) here - they are purely anecdotal. Again, let me say that the person to told me this was not employed or involved with Parag Milk. ***\nParag’s main plant is located in Manchar, on the Pune-Nashik road. The whole region is rich in dairy farms providing a lot of raw material. However, the region is also dotted with a lot of dairy processing plants which means that when supply is poor there is a price war resulting in dairy farmers selling to competitors even when they have a contract in place. Parag does have their own collection of dairy cows so this is mitigated a bit. On a side note, ordinary villagers are awestruck at the way their in-house dairy cows live - in some ways better than some of the poorer people in the area.\nParag’s focus on milk products is good because of longer shelf life for most of them (when compared to packaged milk), higher margins, less government regulations and lower transport costs (milk in packets is comparatively more bulky for the same weight).\nFrom what I’ve observed, Gowardhan has a good market presence in Maharashtra and parts of Karnataka but is limited elsewhere.\nOne risk that I see is that from the customer’s point of view, they do not have any advantage other than the brandname - virtually anyone can start manufacturing the products given the inclination and investment. The milk industry is very fragmented with a lot of local brands. Several dairies in the area have started the installation of cheese and curd plants. Many of these manufacture curd, ghee and cheese as a way of utilizing otherwise wasted milk (many of them are co-operatives which have to buy the milk provided by their members) and so are willing to sell at very low prices.\nThese are all the points that I can think of. I’m glad that I’ve been able to contribute in someway to this site which I’ve been visiting long before I even registered. If you have any follow-up questions I’ll be glad to try and answer them to the best of my ability.

Here is a very interesting video on the entire Cheese making cycle at Amul.

So it requires heavy investments and as a result the cheese industry is highly organized, while share of organized sector is only 20-22% in case of milk.\nAnother important point to note is a large captive cheese production paves the way for whey production. Paraga has the largest single location capacity in India (40MT/day which is being expanded to 60MT/day). So it creates the opportunity for strong foray into whey protein as well.\nThe main action and pie in cheese market is on the institutional side primarily the Hotels-Restaurants-Catering business or HoReCa segment as it is called.

While Fonterra is almost four times the size of Amul in terms of turnover, its strategy was just to procure milk and convert it into commodities such as milk powder or unsalted butter and sell it to dairy companies across the globe, which in turn would convert them into value-added products.

We have ambitious growth plans in the dairy sector, but we will invest in a collection model.”\nParag knows it is a small player among the big bulls, hence it has differetiated in strategy while making sure, it has invested fairly well in the collection model of its own.\n“Our strategy is to differentiate.

A combination of globalisation, organised retail and capitalism has collectively skewed milk production and consumption. I don’t think this is restricted to just the milk business though and this disruption in the last 10 years has been at play in a lot of sectors.\nA lot of capacity gets built in a growing market, growing market encourages consumption, as the scale gets bigger and bigger, more players jump in and try to grab a larger market share, then comes the painful consolidation where only the largest and toughest survive due to economies of scale while the small ones who unwittingly participated in the early stages get assimilated/crushed by the behemoths. Globalisation makes the whole world a market and capacities that get built in one place to serve the whole world can get adversely affected by policy changes in another country and consequently the whole sector in the country undergoes pain.\nI think instead of SMP which gets converted back to milk by recombining with butter fat, slowly more and more milk will be converted to Cheese and the per-capita consumption of Cheese will go up because capitalism causes these consumption patterns. I doubt if much can happen in terms of structural changes recommended in the piece. Keeping the business local and maintaining social and ecological resilience will take a lot of effort from the govt. The govt. will take the easy way out and throw money at the problem with a minimum support price causing further distortions in the long run, as they have done in the Sugar sector.

No direct answers! Seemed like mgmt was beating around the bush.\nFew turn-offs for me…\nThey said Vector Consulting experiment has been extremely successful and they have completed that experimenr for Mumbai, but when asked to share some data for the same, they sort of backed out saying they will share it \"may be in next 2-3 months’. Why? At least share some insights. Just saying it has been successfully in every concall when asked from last 4 qtrs without backing it up with any numbers whatsoever cannot be trusted.\nWhy acquire another milk additive brand - Nutrisattva\" when Parag already got a large product portfolio in the same segment with its own brand Avvatar? They proposed to buy this new brand having around 2 cr sales at 80 lacs. But what is the need? No satisfactory explanations given!\nWhy not share revenue numbers or at least give investors some hint about the progress they have made on Avvatar over last 2 years, especially when they were so gung ho about it few qtrs back and launched it with so much fanfare last year? Categorical denial when asked about revenue breakdown can be a policy, but saying that they will share details when something ‘meaningful’ happens (10 cities) is very odd and goes against their own repeatef comments in all concalls that Avvatar is “showing great promise”. I didn’t like this. Things must be backed with numbers especially when the new category is well past the launch date (almost 2 years). It’s okay to say it is making losses or it is not up to the mark till date or they are trying something. But, saying it is doing very well repeatedly, but not backing up with even a trace of numbers is a big turn off. Probably hiding something?\nOperating Cash Flow explanation was all but convincing! It appeared that the person asking that question was prematurely dropped-off from the call when he tried grilling on the issue. His question was relevant and the answer wasn’t clear. They mentioned something in the last concall and then changed those numbers during this concall. Could be a serious red flag if i understood it correctly.\nWhen asked about working capital days, they have always maintained…“it is similar to last qtr”. Well, why not give a specific and direct answer? Though, when grilled with back of hand cash flow and working capital calculation, numbers didn’t add up for working capital days. And the person asking couldn’t continue due to concall rule of asking just 2 questions at a time. It was actually one question, which was followed by an unvlear answer. So he was trying to dig deeper.\nRecent management changes also give an uneasy feeling, especially when they were so upbeat about the talent they managed to bring in order to portray good management feel and FMCG status! Few of those guys joined only a few qtrs back with so much fanfare, with lengthy introductions in concall. Many of them leaving within 2-3 qtrs? Odd?\nLifting milk to Singapore and the explanation offered for the same when asked why not target other Indian metros left me stumped. I understand that Pride of Cow is their flagship brand which helps promote Paeag’s overall image rather than contributing to the revenues meaningfully, but at the same time i believe they need to put in their energies in something worthwhile (80:20), which would really count. Lifting milk to Singapore is an eye grabber for sure, but doesn’t help company’s cause. Then, when grilled on the overall plan for this farm fresh milk, they said they want to expand it to 40 cities (currently 2-3 cities). When asked how much revenue they are targeting out of this venture, answer was doubling the current revenue. Well, going from 3 cities to 40, and revenue just doubles. These answers were very incoherent and vague!\nConstant addition of new brands and products like gulab jamuns and sweets, mishti dahi, top up and what not. Well, it seems they just want to remain in news with useless product launches. No follow-ups whatsoever on the revenue from those products and categories. Then, few qtrs later, they would term those products as experiments.\nNo doubt these guys managed to create two good brands and certainly have a mind-share when it comes to gowardhan ghee and go cheese. But, their persistence for being in limelight and begging investors to give FMCG valuation has always been troubling.\nIn related party transactions, there is one entry (guarantees to Shah family from the company) which always troubled me (close to 450 cr) and has been increasing every year. I am not sure about the same so i tried asking Vimal Agarwal (ex-CFO) about the same through email but didn’t get any satisfactory answer.

Although the capacity addition would depend upon the finished product, technically the company will be able to produce higher volumes by 33% of the current capacity.\nWith this new capacity, now the company can generate a double digit sales growth in future for next 3 years. Management expects barring an uneven quarter of one or two due to additional depreciation due to the capex and incidental expenditure costs, growth momentum will remain intact going forward.\nVeterinary segment is poised for a strong growth in the next 3- 5 years. Lot of outsourcing opportunities has emerged in this sector.\nThe company has 2 long term contracts and needed more capacities and scale to get the long term contracts. With the added capacity, management is trying for such 3-5 contracts which it expects to receive by the year FY’17.\nThe margins for Q1 FY’17 were helped by higher offtake of high margin products by an international customer in exports business along with rupee depreciation. It’s difficult to determine the margin exactly as different products have different margins. On an average, given the fall in raw material prices and a depreciated rupee, average Ebidta margin will be around 19-20%.\nMore than 90% of company’s business is API’s. More than 80% of the total business is exports.\nThe growth going forward will come from existing products to existing customers, new products to existing customers, existing products to new customers and new products to new customers.\nFor FY’17, management expects net sales of around Rs 110 crore\nThe company does process tests of only off patented and matured products in its lab and has delivered about 16-18 API products. 3 more are in the pipeline for FY’17.\nPost the completion of capex program, management expects dividend to be declared from FY’17 onwards.\nSource - Capital Line','Oct 5, 2016 1:16 pm'),(4296,370,22,'When does the added capacity come into operation.

Though they do veterinary formulations and human API in small proportions, the focus areas is veterinary API. Company is NOT focused on US and Europe markets. US and Europe require huge investments and long gestation periods. There is enough scope in unregulated markets of Latin American and African markets. The company supplies to formulation manufacturers of those countries as well as to MNCs. This will be strategy going forward as well. The company earlier needed agents to supply to these markets. Now due to better relationships developed over past 5 years company supplies to formulation companies directly. This has reduced the commission costs of the company.\nExpansions:\nCurrent 30cr expansion in Tarapur is almost 90% complete. First phase will be completed by October and by Jan second phase will be ready. Plant will be fully operational for FY19. Total sales can be 60-70cr from this capex in next 2-3 years. There are customer waiting for this capex to complete. The expansion is for current set of molecules already manufactured.The plants has zero liquid discharge and fully automated which require very less man power.\nOnly this capacity reached 50% of the new capacity, company has plans for next round of capex for which company has already procured the land. This capex can be for around 50cr. The company is already seeding the market with these new products/molecules.\nR&D folks will be increased from 18 to 30 in next 3 years. Mostly MSc and PhDs\nMargins expanded due to following reasons\n1 Energy conservation due to better heat recovery systems. Water usage was halved. Recovery of water heat.\n2. Minimise wastage lead to almost 2% improvement\n3. Strong r&d - improved yield efficiency and strong processes. Processes were improved for older molecules which lead to better cost efficiency.\nOther points:\nThe company works on 90 day credit and there are 30 days for shipment. Hence receivables will always be high for the company.\nCompany works only with USD. Forward cover with continuous hedge.\nCapital will be deployed back in business rather than dividend at least for next one year.\nCompetitors include sequent and Lasa in listed space. There are 30-40 companies in unlisted space who are competitors.\n30% of sales are long term contract. Remaining are spot contracts.\nI would rate the management highly for\na) for clear strategy and focus of attacking unregulated markets first\nb) seeding market for new molecules and planning next set of capacities ahead of time ( giving good future visibility for next few years)\nc) cost optimization measures leading to higher margins\nd)Less customer concentration risks.

The factories are running non-stop, just making do with basic maintenance. The orders taken up for new capacity which got affected by fire are being fulfilled by the current capacities. Current quarterly run rate is expected to continue for ongoing financial year and 130-135 cr revenues look achievable. The co. is actually starved of capacity and can’t meet demand. Operations at 115% are not sustainable for long and the levels will come down in due time as and when new capacities can be commercialised. New capacities were ready for trial runs around Sept-Oct 2017 and after completion of all the required trials and tests commercialisation was to start in June after final approvals. The incident of fire has pushed back the co. by 6-9 months and commercialisation of new capacities will only start in next financial year if not earlier. The total loss is estimated to be around 5-6 crs. An insurance claim will be lodged for the same in due time. The new capacities will manufacture existing and new products both. New capacities will contribute around 75 cr in revenues at peak considering 2.5x churn.\nThe co. plans to expand capacity further after 50% utilisation levels are achieved for the recently added capacity. The investment required will be 50 cr and this capacity should be ready by the time all the capacity ( old+new) reaches full utilisation, expectedly in 3 year’s time.\nConsistent margins in the range of 20% over a period of time is a result of continuous improvement in processes and backward integration. Margins over a period of time will trend in 20% ± 4% depending on currency and raw material situation. June quarter margins have been aided a bit by forex gain. Pertaining to fy19, margins will remain under pressure because new capacity added is as good as ready and incurring expenses which are being reflected in the P&L.\nThe top 3 products contribute roughly 50% of the sales. The co. has 60-80% market share in these product markets and the same is expected to grow by 10-12%\nThe co. will introduce 4 new products once the new capacities commercialise, 2 in category of mammals and 2 in category of Poultry. The co. is entering the Poultry market for first time. Poultry market is bigger in size as compared to mammals. The co. is in an advantageous position as existing customers also cater to Poultry segment and have been demanding products from NGL for the same. Domestic market for Poultry is also big and co. hopes of achieving 1/3rd of the sales from the same.\nThe co. will keep introducing 2-3 products every year. Half of the R&D team is focused on product development and half on process improvement.\nThe customers demand NGL’s products as its lowest in cost, high in quality and service is reliable.\nDemand scenario is favourable as unregulated markets hold scope for penetration.\nThe co. has plans in back of its minds to foray in regulated markets in distant future through a dedicated plant. Currently, it’s just getting it’s feet wet trying to make sense of it.\nThe co. is not exposed to emerging market currency risks as 99% of sales are dollar denominated.\nThe management mentioned that it’s plants are one of the best catering to unregulated markets.

In addition, we have taken various initiatives including reducing water, wastage and even liquid discharge to improve our profitability. Over the long term we should be able to maintain 20 +/- 4% PBILDT margins. The profitability margins depend on commodity prices especially crude. However, we are able to largely pass on the increase in raw material prices to our customers. Over the past one year, prices of lot of raw materials and intermediates have increased by 50 – 100% and these have been fully passed onto our customers.”\nProduct pipeline & R&D : The company had plans to introduce 4 new products including two for poultry from the new plant but the same has been postponed to next year post commencement of operations of new plant. Poultry API is a bigger market than mammal API markets we serve. Top 3 products constitute 50% of our sales. In these molecules we have 60 – 80% market share in the unregulated market. These molecules are pretty old and growing at a steady rate of 8 – 10%. We plan to introduce 3 – 4 new products every year. Our R&D team consists of 30 employees including 3 PhDs and 11 MSc. One of the PhD scientist has experience of drug discovery while the other one has done PhD from abroad. We pay them pretty well. 50% of time of the R&D team goes for optimising the reactions for current molecules being manufactured by the company while the remaining goes on working for new molecules.\nAccordingly we can understand some of the expenses being forward looking and can’t be cut so easily.\nOverall, the story seems positive going forward.\nDisc: Invested','Feb 8, 2020 1:58 pm'),(4332,370,119,'Firstly, thanks to all the seniors and members who have made this thread so insightful.\nI’ve been following NGL for a few months and trying to understand the business.\nHave been reading ValuePickr forums and decided to start with Business Model Canvas first (before jumping to Business Quality Insights and the recent Mental Models Framework) , following is my analysis (the underlined questions in the attachment are the things which I need help in, to understand the business better and are reproduced below for everyone’s convenience) NGL_Business Model Canvas_Ansh-Gupta.pdf (72.9 KB)\nRequest you all to throw some light on this\nGiven that NGL operates in unregulated and price sensitive markets, how do the customers react when the company increase prices? (the company mentioned in AGM’19 that about 10-15% growth came from price increase)\nThe objective for asking this is to understand how sustainable is this practice going forward\nWhen selling products to customers, how is the pricing decided exactly?\nIs the price fixed for everyone/does it depend on quantity/varies by the size of customer/else\nHow does the company approach/discover new customers?\nThere were a few other questions too which might not be relevant (I wasn’t sure, therefore separating them from the above ones):\na) For either imports/exports, they must be using a partner, right? Is there a need to dig into this in terms of how it can affect the business\nb) Since 80-85% raw materials are available domestically, is there a need to look into the concentration of suppliers? In terms of how a supply chain disruption may be caused if the company is dependent on 1-2 suppliers only?\nc) Since the capex requirement is huge, is there any alternative for this? Do similar companies rent factories instead?\nBesides analyzing the business, I tried to gain some insights on Sustainability, Longevity, Scalability and Peer Comparison, would love to hear everyone’s views on the same:\n1. Sustainability\nFor every Rs 100 sale, ~ Rs 43 is used in fixed capital investment and ~ Rs 31 is used in working capital, so the only way for the company to meaningfully grow is keep increasing sales at 15-20% every year\nThe above point also suggests that NGL Finechem is not a business which can cause ‘disproportionate growth’ but can still grow at 15-20%\nNGL’s numbers for FC and WC are pretty similar to that of Sequent, so I’m assuming it cannot be improved upon\n(The numbers for working capital and fixed capital have been taken from ‘Price Implied Expectation’ from the mental models thread excel)\nThe question about sustainability is that can the figures of 15%+ sales growth, 20-25% ROE, 20% ROIC be continued? Why/Why not?\nI’m of the opinion that since sales growth is not too magnificent (nothing like 30-40% YoY) and the company has shown that it’s niche strategy is working, it can be sustained which will further drive the other metrics positively\n2. Longevity\nOne major question here is, how long is the runway for the company? 3 years? 5 years? 10 years?\nThis is directly related to the quality and sources of growth, which are the following according to me:\nHigh Quality Growth:\na) Commercializing new products in its existing markets\nThe company develops ~2 products every year and that should help drive sales\nApproximately, the market size of current products is ~1000cr and the company seems to have captured ~15% of that\nRoughly, size of each molecule is around 40-50cr, so every year the market size keeps expanding somewhere between 80-100cr (8-10%)\nb) Gaining market share in older products\nThe company has consistently shown that it’s a market leader in older products and this, along with the above point should help drive growth\nc) Untested poultry segment in which company has recently decided to enter\nThis cannot really be counted on since the company doesn’t have any experience in this segment and the molecule size is much bigger (~200cr), it is bound to attract more competition\nLower quality of growth (can only help to an extent) can come from d) Price Increase and e) Cost reduction\n3. Scalability\nSeems like the only way to scale is\na) to keep adding new production facilities (a bit capex heavy, as management has said they’ll require 100cr capex for the next 5 years out of which about 60% is new capex)\nb) to develop new molecules\nThe unregulated markets are growing at a faster pace compared to regulated markets (6-7% +) and that should help the company increase its scale\n4. Peer Comparison\nHere, I wasn’t sure on how exactly to go about it (request someone to guide me), so I did the following:\nIn terms of financials, NGL seems to be clearly outperforming its peers- Sequent and LASA in most aspects like superior ROE, OPM, Net Profit Margin etc (Numbers taken from Screener)\nFor Sequent, their focus seems to be more on the regulated markets, having setup a USFDA plant in Vizag (as per their annual report) and their major revenue driver is Formulations (70%) while Animal API is about 30% so I’m not sure how comparable it is\nLASA seems to have taken a bad beating, and doesn’t seem to be much of a threat now','May 23, 2020 11:54 am'),(4333,370,175,'Adding my notes from Q4 call.

Although the capacity addition would depend upon the finished product, technically the company will be able to produce higher volumes by 33% of the current capacity.\nWith this new capacity, now the company can generate a double digit sales growth in future for next 3 years. Management expects barring an uneven quarter of one or two due to additional depreciation due to the capex and incidental expenditure costs, growth momentum will remain intact going forward.\nVeterinary segment is poised for a strong growth in the next 3- 5 years. Lot of outsourcing opportunities has emerged in this sector.\nThe company has 2 long term contracts and needed more capacities and scale to get the long term contracts. With the added capacity, management is trying for such 3-5 contracts which it expects to receive by the year FY’17.\nThe margins for Q1 FY’17 were helped by higher offtake of high margin products by an international customer in exports business along with rupee depreciation. It’s difficult to determine the margin exactly as different products have different margins. On an average, given the fall in raw material prices and a depreciated rupee, average Ebidta margin will be around 19-20%.\nMore than 90% of company’s business is API’s. More than 80% of the total business is exports.\nThe growth going forward will come from existing products to existing customers, new products to existing customers, existing products to new customers and new products to new customers.\nFor FY’17, management expects net sales of around Rs 110 crore\nThe company does process tests of only off patented and matured products in its lab and has delivered about 16-18 API products. 3 more are in the pipeline for FY’17.\nPost the completion of capex program, management expects dividend to be declared from FY’17 onwards.\nSource - Capital Line','Jul 23, 2015 1:33 pm'),(4340,370,22,'When does the added capacity come into operation.

Though they do veterinary formulations and human API in small proportions, the focus areas is veterinary API. Company is NOT focused on US and Europe markets. US and Europe require huge investments and long gestation periods. There is enough scope in unregulated markets of Latin American and African markets. The company supplies to formulation manufacturers of those countries as well as to MNCs. This will be strategy going forward as well. The company earlier needed agents to supply to these markets. Now due to better relationships developed over past 5 years company supplies to formulation companies directly. This has reduced the commission costs of the company.\nExpansions:\nCurrent 30cr expansion in Tarapur is almost 90% complete. First phase will be completed by October and by Jan second phase will be ready. Plant will be fully operational for FY19. Total sales can be 60-70cr from this capex in next 2-3 years. There are customer waiting for this capex to complete. The expansion is for current set of molecules already manufactured.The plants has zero liquid discharge and fully automated which require very less man power.\nOnly this capacity reached 50% of the new capacity, company has plans for next round of capex for which company has already procured the land. This capex can be for around 50cr. The company is already seeding the market with these new products/molecules.\nR&D folks will be increased from 18 to 30 in next 3 years. Mostly MSc and PhDs\nMargins expanded due to following reasons\n1 Energy conservation due to better heat recovery systems. Water usage was halved. Recovery of water heat.\n2. Minimise wastage lead to almost 2% improvement\n3. Strong r&d - improved yield efficiency and strong processes. Processes were improved for older molecules which lead to better cost efficiency.\nOther points:\nThe company works on 90 day credit and there are 30 days for shipment. Hence receivables will always be high for the company.\nCompany works only with USD. Forward cover with continuous hedge.\nCapital will be deployed back in business rather than dividend at least for next one year.\nCompetitors include sequent and Lasa in listed space. There are 30-40 companies in unlisted space who are competitors.\n30% of sales are long term contract. Remaining are spot contracts.\nI would rate the management highly for\na) for clear strategy and focus of attacking unregulated markets first\nb) seeding market for new molecules and planning next set of capacities ahead of time ( giving good future visibility for next few years)\nc) cost optimization measures leading to higher margins\nd)Less customer concentration risks.

Do similar companies rent factories instead?\nBesides analyzing the business, I tried to gain some insights on Sustainability, Longevity, Scalability and Peer Comparison, would love to hear everyone’s views on the same:\n1. Sustainability\nFor every Rs 100 sale, ~ Rs 43 is used in fixed capital investment and ~ Rs 31 is used in working capital, so the only way for the company to meaningfully grow is keep increasing sales at 15-20% every year\nThe above point also suggests that NGL Finechem is not a business which can cause ‘disproportionate growth’ but can still grow at 15-20%\nNGL’s numbers for FC and WC are pretty similar to that of Sequent, so I’m assuming it cannot be improved upon\n(The numbers for working capital and fixed capital have been taken from ‘Price Implied Expectation’ from the mental models thread excel)\nThe question about sustainability is that can the figures of 15%+ sales growth, 20-25% ROE, 20% ROIC be continued? Why/Why not?\nI’m of the opinion that since sales growth is not too magnificent (nothing like 30-40% YoY) and the company has shown that it’s niche strategy is working, it can be sustained which will further drive the other metrics positively\n2. Longevity\nOne major question here is, how long is the runway for the company? 3 years? 5 years? 10 years?\nThis is directly related to the quality and sources of growth, which are the following according to me:\nHigh Quality Growth:\na) Commercializing new products in its existing markets\nThe company develops ~2 products every year and that should help drive sales\nApproximately, the market size of current products is ~1000cr and the company seems to have captured ~15% of that\nRoughly, size of each molecule is around 40-50cr, so every year the market size keeps expanding somewhere between 80-100cr (8-10%)\nb) Gaining market share in older products\nThe company has consistently shown that it’s a market leader in older products and this, along with the above point should help drive growth\nc) Untested poultry segment in which company has recently decided to enter\nThis cannot really be counted on since the company doesn’t have any experience in this segment and the molecule size is much bigger (~200cr), it is bound to attract more competition\nLower quality of growth (can only help to an extent) can come from d) Price Increase and e) Cost reduction\n3. Scalability\nSeems like the only way to scale is\na) to keep adding new production facilities (a bit capex heavy, as management has said they’ll require 100cr capex for the next 5 years out of which about 60% is new capex)\nb) to develop new molecules\nThe unregulated markets are growing at a faster pace compared to regulated markets (6-7% +) and that should help the company increase its scale\n4. Peer Comparison\nHere, I wasn’t sure on how exactly to go about it (request someone to guide me), so I did the following:\nIn terms of financials, NGL seems to be clearly outperforming its peers- Sequent and LASA in most aspects like superior ROE, OPM, Net Profit Margin etc (Numbers taken from Screener)\nFor Sequent, their focus seems to be more on the regulated markets, having setup a USFDA plant in Vizag (as per their annual report) and their major revenue driver is Formulations (70%) while Animal API is about 30% so I’m not sure how comparable it is\nLASA seems to have taken a bad beating, and doesn’t seem to be much of a threat now','Jul 23, 2015 1:33 pm'),(4368,370,175,'Adding my notes from Q4 call.

The company was demerged from Arvind Ltd and listed as a separate entity in March, 2019. The company is engaged in the business of design and fabrication of process equipment which mainly includes heat exchangers, pressure vessels, centrifuges, columns/towers and small reactors that find applications in refineries, petrochemicals, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and other allied industries. Heat exchangers contributed 80 – 90% of the sales while remaining was contributed through sales of pressure vessels, centrifuges, columns/towers and small reactors.\nAbout the product\nHeat exchangers are used to transfer heat or cooling from one liquid to another. Key industries served – oil & gas refineries, petrochemicals, fertilizers, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food and other allied industries. The company has technical collaboration with Lummus Technology for special High Efficiency Heat Exchangers (Helixchanger).\n\n(source: Anup Presentation)\nAbout the industry\nHeat exchanger is a USD 21 billion industry globally – used to increase efficiencies. Largest players in the industry include: - Alfa Laval (>30% market share), Kelvion (Germany), Hisaka (Japan), SPX Flow/APV (US), SWEP (US). High profitability margins with many companies reporting gross margins of more than 45%. Alfa Laval has EBITDA margins of 14 – 15% while its Indian subsidiary also has EBITDA margins of 19%.\nThis is something which Credit Suisse prepared forx capital goods industry (was made for Alfa Laval):\nTransformation Journey of the company\nDespite being in the engineering segment since 1962, the company was not able to scale the business. However, the transformation of the company started when its current CEO – Mr. Rishi Roop Kapoor joined the company in 2010. Mr. Kapoor has pretty good reputation in the engineering industry and is an IIT Roorkee pass out. Prior to joining Anup, he was associated with Godrej and Boyce for more than a decade. The company has become a net cash company during the past few years and generates healthy cash flows.\nKey financials of the company:\nSome of the measures taken to turn around the company include:\nIncreasing market reach with increasing exports: Over the years, the company has increased focus on export markets to reduce cyclicality associated with domestic markets.\nEmpanelment with large EPC players: Despite its relatively smaller size, the company has been able to empanel itself with large global MNC EPC players and customers including Lurgi, Linde, Jacobs, Mitsubishi etc. The company has executed large projects for companies including Dangote Refinery (one of the largest refineries in the world), Reliance, OMCs etc. The key client lists include:\n\n(source: Company presentation)\nImproving designing and manufacturing capabilities – one of the rare companies with entire range of metal processing capabilities under one roof and excellent design capabilities\nIncreasing complexity and weight of the product manufactured: Over the years, the company has increased realization of the equipment manufactured by it as indicated in the graph below:\nSticking to deadlines and avoided paying liquidated damages - Gained confidence of customers leading to repeat buys - Liquidated damages are one of the biggest cost.\nCompetition\nThe company competes with pure play heat exchanger companies including Patel Airtemp and Tema India (unlisted company) as well as large capital goods companies inlcuding ISGEC and L&T. Have done a comparison on the margin profile of Tema and Patel with Anup. Companies like ISGEC and L&T have much diversified product profile and are not strictly comparable.\nAnup has highest margins amongst its peers and even better than much larger and diversified player – One interesting thing to note is the healthy GM of pure play heat exchanger cos which is much more than many capital goods companies.\nWay Forward\nAll time high order book of the company – 300 crore by end of FY19 – largely from domestic market (might impact margins as guided by the management in its maiden concall post Q4FY19 results)\nExpanding capacities – Target to spend 150 crore in capex for brownfield capacity in Odhav, Ahmedabad and greenfield capacity at Kheda – 40 kms from Ahmedabad – to be funded through internal accruals\nLooking for further technological tie ups to enhance capabilities\nTargeting 1000 crore over then next 4 – 5 years\nWhat is attractive about the company?\nLarge industry size globally – new orders expected from all round the globe to improve efficiencies and cleaner fuels from refineries – Euro VI and BS VI implementation. Furthermore, the government owned OMC’s refinery are operating at 105 - 110% capacity utilisation and given the domestic demand of petrol/diesel with growth rates of 10 - 14% every year, these companies are looking at big capex over the next few years to expand their capacities.\nValuation – 42 crore PAT reported in FY19 and market capitalisation of around 500 crore currently. Healthy growth expected in revenues and PAT in FY20.\nAttractive industry dynamics with many players reporting attractive gross margins\nNet cash balance sheet and healthy cash flows.\nGood feedback received from the industry peers about the company and top management.\nKey Risks\nLumpy business – less visibility of revenue beyond one year. Furthermore, revenue can remain volatile on quarterly basis based on dispatches and orders in hand.\nLargely dependent on oil & gas & petrochemical segment\nPeak margins given it reported EBITDA margins of 25% plus during FY19. However, some comfort can be derived from company’s track record of reporting margins in the range of 24 – 28% over the past 5 years.\nWorking capital intensive operations - Its working capital intensive business with working capital cycle remaining between 100 - 180 days. These will also depend on dispatches during the year end.\nLoans and advances extended to Arvind Ltd, its parent: Anup has extended interest bearing loans & advances of Rs.40 crore as on March 31, 2019 to its parent. However, the same can be called back depending on Anup’s fund requirements as per management.\nKey Financials:\nProfit and loss & key ratios\nBalance Sheet & Key Ratios\n(Disclosure: Invested.

In addition, ISGEC and L&T are pretty diversified companies and being in the industry for over decades, dont really think that Anup’s technical capabilities will be superior to them. May be it can also be due to their single minded focus on the heat exchanger segment.\nOne striking thing about the margins of Anup is that EBITDA margins have sustained about 22% plus for 5 years now. If it was for a one or two years, one would have doubted their sustainability. Although, one can still not be sure on the sustainability but 5 years is a pretty long time and does give some comfort. Dont have data on Tema’s employees but Patels Airtemp has 153 employees as on March 31, 2018 and reported 150 crore revenue in FY19.\nb. May be currently because of capacity constraints, they are picking and choosing orders.

Some of the key points I noted in the concall:\n• FY19 – closed on a strong note. Overall revenue grew by 10% excluding the trading income. EBITDA margins grew from 26% to 29% in FY19. Partly on account of higher export realisation. Lower PAT due to higher tax outgo.\n• Revenue declined during Q4. Our quarterly revenue and margins depend on shipment and dispatches during the quarter. H2 revenues increased compared to H2 of last year. Q3 we saw a phenomenal performance. Q1 which is coming up is we can see relatively better nos. Order book continue to remain extremely strong – confirmed order book of 300 crore to be delivered in next 4 – 5 quarters. Significant jump in order book position. Very good market conditions.\n• 1000 crore revenue – aggressive 30% growth in FY20. Pursue two prompt strategy – expanding facility at existing location, adding infrastructure. Also identified a greenfield location as a completely new plant which will augment our capacity. Secondly, adding technologies to augment our existing abilities.\n• Current order book 300 crore – what is average order ticket size? How has it changed over the year? Which verticals contributed to the order book? Margins sustainance over the years? Average ticket size – direct result of the product mix that we have been pursuing over the past 5 – 6 years. Realisation – 1.64 crore per equipment. 50% improvement over last year. Sustainability of margins? Pretty confident about margins. Robust system going for orders. Evaluating the enquiries. Good team of professionals to analyse the complexities and integrities for order we received. Each order are made to order. During the pre-order only, pricing will take care of it. Confident about maintaining our margins. 300 crore – confident about 25% EBITDA margins for FY20 also.\n• Reason for demand – Partly demand for BS VI regulations – stringent norms in developing countries. First round of clean fuel base. Happened in last decade and a half. Same wave is now hitting us. On a longer term we are expecting – Usd 150 billion invested in refineries. In the next year we have projections of USD 500 billion to be invested in the sector. Other sectors also doing well like fertilizer plants. Also in LNG seeing demand. Largest producer of coal in the world. Like to use coal in a cleaner manner. Lot of emphasis into coal gasification plant. Outlook for next 10 years is good.\n• Capex of 150 crore – Revenue from the new plant? Capex for new facility at Kheda included in it. Similar asset turns that we are seeing here.\n• Linde and Faxir merger – Market leaders for hydrogen plant – Linde – preferred vendors for them. Participating in global plants with them. Most complicated equipment – one of their structured vendors and partners. Faxir supplied in US and India. Merger will have a positive impact on us.\n• Export as % of sales and how is it growing over the years? Export % tends to vary as far as we are concerned. Varying pretty significantly.\n• Got export incentives which impacted margins? Can have positive impact like it had this year by 2 – 3%. Export orders are more profitable than domestic markets. Exports will be our focus going forward. In Fy20 - % of exports will be lower this year and that’s the reason margin can be lower to around 25% in Fy20.\n• What gives confidence moving from 220 crore to 1000 crore in next 4 – 5 years? We had a very good rate of growth in past 5 years. Operating from same capacity and infrastructure. Primary reason – enhancing the product mix. One reason which has allowed us to show the growth despite adverse market conditions. Almost 85% of the orders we get is repeat orders. Best record in the industry for delivering on time is concerned. Improve manufacturing capability. Inspires confidence by customers to trust. Engineering skills enhanced. New dimensions. Have been able to reach out to MNC customers after thorough audit by them. Huge potential in the market. Significant infrastructure that we have planned in Kheda and we will be able to cater to export markets.\n• Products that we have introduced in the next 4 – 5 years? How is the technology tie up shaping up? We have been able to enhance our product mix – more complicated technologies and exotic metals like titanium etc. technology tie up also playing a role. We had another technology partner – we have signed new agreement with that company. Also, have plans to tie up with another technology leader who is the leader. Technology tie up will remain high in our agenda and help us grow to 1000 crore.\n• Order book break up of industry and how much time taken? 300 crore – 90% heat exchanger – 260 crore shell and tube heat exchange, some pressure vessels, reactors etc – Refineries and integrated petrochemical plants and fertilizers which are coming up.\n• Order and execution cycle works for us? Cycle is not able to predict from taking bid to us to delivery. Manufacturing cycle for our kind of equipment varies from 30 days to 200 days depending on complexity etc. Able to cater to wide range of equipment. Order months materialization 30 to 60 days.\n• New facility coming up in Kheda – shifting existing line from Odhav to Kheda? Kheda – on stream 12 to 18 months. Facility at Odhav will continue.\n• Next year margins should be around 25% - export incentive benefit this year was around 2 – 3%.\n• Working capital cycle – working capital cycle has improved FY18 to FY19 – Further improvement in working capital cycle? This nos to continue next year as well.\n• Capacity expansion – potential revenue? Difficult to make projections. Make this facility as world class facility. Actual nos will depend on orders we receive.\n• Oveall outlook for order book inflow – very positive. Concerned projects which have been announce. Very strong pipeline\n• 300 crore order book – 15% is the export mix\n• Client concentration – how many customers there? For the next year, 85% sale is domestic – fertlizers plants, refineries, petrochemical – coming with different EPC businesses cos like Technip etc. Do we work directly with customers or epc contractors? Work with both. Directly smaller projects, breakdown or replacement. Larger projects managed by EPC contractors.\n• Metal consumed for the product. How do we manage metal price volatility? Strong way to analyse the orders. Confirmed quotations. Close orders in short time and book raw materials. Debtor and inventory cycle for orders? Within a year, the project getting executing, why such debtors and inventory? Cant look at past few years. Growth will lead to higher debtors and inventory. Forward nos please. Get advances against orders? No there are partly we get advances – 15 – 20% advances we get.\n• Order inflow pipeline is quite strong – traction from domestic market or export market looking good. Current year is predominantly domestic. Order pipeline strong for export and domestic both.\n• Capex for FY19 – 40 crore.\n• De-growth in topline reason for it? In our business, it actually depends on customer requirements and their priorities. Better to compare H2 with last financial year, revenue have grown from 124 crore to 143 crore compared to last year. Expecting nos in Q1 compared to corresponding period.\n• Employee cost increased by 30% - partly on account of new people we added. Cross functions as well. If we look at on % basis of topline, its much lower. Industry norms – 9 – 13% while in our case its 8 – 9%. It will stay at same level as % of revenue.\n• Segment wise contribution from revenue changes every year.\n• How much incremental capacity we can generate from Kheda expansion and capex in Odhav? Help us in reaching 1000 crore in next 4 – 5 years.\n• Planned – 150 crore capex for next 3 years.\n• Investment in refineries and fertilizer sector? Scope for us? Tremendous scope.

It was the first company to set-up a Synthetic Camphor plant in India in 1964 with technology from Dupont, USA.\n– Established in 1974, in huge 40 acre land at Baroda, Malti-Chem Research Centre signifies company’s prime focus on R&D.\n– In 1999, company ventured into manufacture of specialty F&F Ingredients (Aroma Chemicals) via in-house developed technology developed at its own R&D Centre.\n– In 2009, change of promoters/management took place wherein CAP was acquired from then promoters – Dalal Family by current promoters – Bodani Family via their flagship company Oriental Aromatics Ltd.\n– In 2013, by using the expertise and reach of new promoters, company undertook a major expansion of its F&F Ingredients’ manufacturing capacity to the tune of 155 % (1.5x) and ventured into production of Galaxolide Musk with Technology & product-Marketing support from Agan Aroma, an Israel based company pioneer in Aroma Chemical industry. It set-up one of the world’s most advanced Polycyclic Musk manufacturing plant and captured ~30 % of the global marketshare of Galaxolide Musk within a span of just 3 years.\n– In 2014, company inked a long-term manufacturing and supply agreement with International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF) – 3rd Largest player in Global F&F industry enjoying 12.50 % marketshare of world F&F market – to manufacture and supply Fragrance Ingredients’ Intermediates and Finished Products.\n– In 2015, company acquired certain indentiified assets & liabilities of Arofine Group (Arofine+Vaishnavi) — a group incorporated in 1976 with 4 state-of-the-art specialty F&F Ingredients’ manufacturing plants in Dombivali & Ambernath, Maharashtra for a consideration of INR 17.50. cr. Arofine Group was an existing supplier to leading global F&F companies like IFF, Givaudan & Symrise and had expertise to manufacture ~200 high value specialty F&F Ingredients. Two key promoters of Arofine Group joined CAP as CEO & R&D Head of newly formed Specialty Chemical Division.\n– In 2016, company undertook an expansion in F&F Ingredients manufacturing capacity to the tune of 18 % (to be commissioned in Q1FY18) at a cost of INR 40 cr… Expansion is into high value specialty F&F Ingredients (inline with that manufactured by Arofine Group) space – used majorly by MNCs in premium FMCG products’ & Fine Fragrances.\n– Also, in 2016, promoters decided to merge their only flagship company – Oriental Aromatics Ltd. – with CAP in lieu of increasing their stake in merged listed entity from current 57.66 % to 74.16 %. NOC from stock exchanges is already received and application filed in Bombay High Court on 26th October 2016 – all formalities expected to get completed by Q4FY17.\n– Incorporated in 1973, F&F Blends business (which is to be merged with CAP) enjoys second largest Indian-origin player status in Indian F&F Blends segment after SH Kelkar and overall sixth largest player status in Indian F&F Blends space after MNCs Givaudan, IFF, Firmenich & Symrise.\n– F&F Blends business of CAP has sustained its positioning amidst onslaught of rising presence of MNCs in Indian F&F space as also emergence of numerous small private players over last 10 years which saw many Indian players getting wiped out completely and loose considerable market-share.\nIndustry Details :\nAttached is a pdf file giving almost all the details of Industry of operation of CAP from varied angles.

SH Kelkar has already given a guidance to grow its revenues over next few years at a CAGR of 15 %.\nTop 10 players in Indian F&F Blends space are Givaudan, IFF, Firmenich, SH Kelkar, Symrise, CAP (via Oriental), Mane, Aarav, Goldfield & Ultra International – exactly in the same given order with Givaudan being No. 1 player and Ultra International being No. 10 player. Out of these, Givaudan, IFF, Firmenich, Symrise & Mane are MNCs.\n– Isn’t CAP, with its forward integrated business approach better than standalone Aroma Chemical players like Privi Organics which have a backward integrated business approach and are ultimately dependent on players like CAP (Blends business) for growth ??\n– Isn’t CAP the only play available which offers a balanced exposure to both the high growing segments of F&F Industry – viz., F&F Blends as well as F&F Ingredients — SH Kelkar offers exposure to growth opportunities of F&F Blends space as its F&F Ingredients business (via PFW Aroma) is not a focus area atall whereas Fairchem Specialities (Privi Organics) offers exposure to growth opportunities of F&F Ingredients space (aroma chemicals) with no presence in Blends Formulation.\n– Won’t inhouse manufacturing capability of 60 % of RM used make CAP’s blends business much more efficient and will give its clientle much more confidence in it than others. Infact, even SH Kelkar lacks such capability and post Baroda expansion, CAP will likely be the only Indian player which will have such capability. This is not to say that CAP will become superior to SH Kelkar, not atall,-- SH Kelkar has a robust R&D Infra and set-up which no peer can compete with for years to come (in F&F Blends space). However, after SH Kelkar, CAP will be the second best choice for any clientle and with these capabilities, CAP can expect to pitch for contracts directly in competition with SH Kelkar.\n– Won’t the Gross Margin of Blends business will significantly improve because of internal procurement of majority of RM.\n– Tie-up with IFF has so far not contributed meaningfully to CAP financials – so, aren’t Arofine acquisition as well as commissioning of Baroda-expanded capacities the building blocks for this tie-up to start bearing fruits from FY18 onwards ??\n– Company has so far refrained from any sort of equity dilution over last 16 years – whether its old management or new one — infact, it is interesting to note that even new promoters’ family have never diluted equity in lifetime of their flagship company Oriental Aromatics Ltd. despite many ups and downs of the industry . So, will the rise in promoter holding to 74.16 % (from current 57.66 %) post merger will act as an incentive to dilute equity going ahead.\n– Won’t 74.16 % holding change the silent approach of the management and make them more proactive as far as IR communications goes.\n– Won’t the extremely successful listing and widespread institutional participation of the only other big Indian peer – SH Kelkar — prompt the management to have proactive talk with institutional investors and therefore improve on IR disclosures.\nThere are also some questions that arise on risk side :\n– What if tommorow Galaxolide Musk is banned ?\n– Current demonetisation is surely going to have some sort of impact on Q4FY17 financials (Q3FY17 might not be that impacted as there is usually 30-40 days lag period) since majority of clientle will be getting impacted. However, players like SH Kelkar and CAP will be better placed as they have clientle diversified across all industries ranging from Soap Manufacturers to Agarbatthi Manufacturers to Perfume Manufacturers to Ready-to-Eat Manufacturers.\n– Mr. Trump becoming president – will he completely ban imports (a wild guess) and therefore one of the prime market for Aroma Chemicals might be in trouble. However, here too, SH Kelkar & CAP will be least impacted relative to all other peers because of their extremely low exports. SHK & CAP exports as % to sales is at 37 % v/s peers’ 65-70 %.\n– Only Listed on BSE & Illiquid nature of company’s stock.\nDiscl. - Invested in Camphor & Allied Products Ltd.

I have a habit of concentrated holding so these points are crucial for me. What I will do here is present my point of view.\nFirst, some corrections on your points,\nEV at CMP post giving effect to merger will be ~680 cr. and not 430 cr. as you mentioned.\nSecondly, on @indirachitra point asto what kind of growth we are looking at going ahead — what I can see as of today is company’s F&F Blends business reaching a scale of 175 cr. by FY19 with 15 % EBITDA margin, F&F Ingredients business reaching a scale of 280 cr. by FY19 with 14-16 % EBITDA margin, Specialty Chemicals reaching a scale of 18 cr. by FY19 with 14 % EBITDA margin and Camphor & Byproducts maintaining a scale of 170 cr. till FY19 with 8 % EBITDA margin.\nSo, by FY19, we are looking at a consolidated scale of ~640 cr. with 81-87 cr. EBITDA. Now, the beauty is, in these three fiscals, we will have a cumulative operating cash generation of ~120 cr. out of which to reach the said ~640 cr. scale, hardly 30 cr. will be expensed out and post the supply of initial quantities of high value specialty aroma chemicals to IFF, in all probability, capacities of some particular chemicals will be expanded, much the same way Galaxolide Musk capacities were expanded in 2013 after supply of initial quantities to Agan.\nWhen F&F Blends business is approaching a scale of 200 cr. per year and F&F Ingredients business is approaching a scale of 300 cr. per year with market dominating position in many of the products, investors don’t value the stock cheaply like 6.5-7x EV/EBITDA, 0.90xEV/Sales and 11-12x P/E.\nWhat as an investor, I need to assure myself of is —\n(1) Is the business scalable — even a 10 % CAGR for next 5-7 years is fine on a 500 cr. scale.\n(2) Is the business going to remain profitable — even a 12-13 % EBITDA on a consistent basis is good.\n(3) Is the business going to generate cash — even an average 30-40 % EBITDA to Cash generation is great.\n(4) Is the positioning of the company in its business segment prominent and sustainable ??\n(5) Is the business segment in which company is present offers a growth visibility by itself ?? A 10 % CAGR visibility for the industry itself is quite comforting – forget here, vast untapped export market.\n(6) Is the company over-owned or under-owned ?? A 0 % institutional holding at a 500 cr. scale of operation with 12 % + EBITDA margin is the holding structure I love to own.\n(7) Are promoters going to loose more than minority shareholders in case of a failure ?? With a 74.16 % promoter holding post merger, promoters themselves can’t afford to get things wrong.\nNow, if the answer to all above is YES then what I am doing is securing downsides to my capital invested – which is crucial for a concentrated pf strategy whereas upsides normally come as and when more and more investors find the company non-ignorable.\nTo me, the best valuation for investment is:\nnot when a company is trading too cheap (except exceptional cases of general meltdown) as at that point there is huge question mark on company’s future ;\nnor when a company is trading too expensive (except exceptional cases of robust high-pace growth visibility) as at that point, story is already widely known and positives are more or less discounted and company at that point needs to continue to execute well as widely anticipated otherwise loss of capital invested gets significant ;\nIts the reasonable valuation, which is not too cheap nor too expensive, which is the best valuation of investment for me as at that point, story is still evolving with judicious mixture of positives and question marks priced in but not fully on each side – which leaves ample scope of safe capital appreciation in case positives outweigh question marks during execution and in case question marks outweigh positives, there is no significant capital loss involved.\nNow, on the tiny industry size as mentioned by @veejoo — yes its a ~5000 cr. tiny industry size (blends business) but what is the structure of the industry ??? Even on a global landscape, 10 players control 70 % of the market and the same is the scenario in every pocket where F&F Industry flourishes.\n– Why aren’t we looking at another side of coin wherein industry is likely to become a 7500 cr. industry within 3 years — a 10-11 % industry CAGR is not enough for our investment at 10x EV/EBITDA and 15 P/E ??\n– How many new players are likely to emerge in the industry and how easy for them is to succeed ?? Already have enlisted entry barriers of F&F Blends industry in my Industry_Details file —\n– An industry where you own the IP of your creation and client is completely dependent on you — how many industries gives this opportunity ?? How crucial you are to your client in such a scenario ??\n– 40 % capacity utilisation is by choice and not by compulsion ?? One where demand is not there and so capacity utilisation of the industry is 40-50 % – that is a scenario which will see crash in prices and therefore margin of players involved ----however, a scenario where you are investing beforehand and building a warchest to secure more and more lucrative orders in future – prices will be maintained and with improving utilisation, your margins will further improve.\nSecond is the case with F&F Blends players like SH Kelkar and Oriental — whereas SH Kelkar is working at 45 % capacity utilisation, Oriental is working at 55 % capacity utilisation – however, both have invested beforehand to secure long-term contracts and penetrate MNC clientle.\n– Is the entry in the industry so easy wherein you need to maintain ~170 days inventory, your debtor days are ~80 days and you need to handle thousands of clients — whereas SH Kelkar handles 4000 + customers, Oriental handles 1500 + customers.\n– Whereas in one F&F Blend, 500 different ingredients are used – even a cheap 1.5 lakh per MT priced ingredient is used and an expensive 20 lakh per MT ingredient is used — whereas a cheap 1.5 lakh MT ingredient is available abunduntly because of production quantities involved, expensive specialty ingredients are produced in hardly 100s of tons quantities p.a. worldwide – so, how many new entrants wil have the capability to set-up production base for such high value specialty ingredients and therefore ensure hold on supply and quality of the said ingredients ??\n– It is very important to understand the industry to assess its opportunity w.r.t. its size — this is the reason why I gave market-share details of 2005 as well as 2015 — whereas new players enter every industry, whether big or small — only strong players sustain — and the industry is going to remain dominated by top 10 players — if you observe closely, strong players of yesterday like Khhatri are non-existent today in top 10 and players like Goldfield have shifted their focus to export market as they were unable to sustain in Indian market.\n– Secondly, and most importantly, 5000 cr. industry size that you are seeing and is mentioned in SH Kelkar presentation is for 24 % of the revenue of Camphor & Allied (Blends business) — what about other business segment industry size ?? Synthetic Aroma Chemical industry alone is worth ~25,000 cr. worldwide and add to that Synthetic Camphor business size too. So, its actually ~40,000 cr. market size the company is catering to and one can’t look in isolation.\nJust refer here following table :\nIf we look at crucial business parameters, Oriental is consistently having better inventory days, better Debtor days and inferior Creditor Days than its peers whose valuation we have considered for benchmarking.\nNow, if sustainable EBITDA of Oriental improves to 15 %, why should market value this company too cheaply as compared to peers ?? And with commissioning of Baroda expanded capacities, exactly this I feel will happen.\nWhen I invest I own a business and therefore I like to study the industry as well company strategy inside out before taking my investment decision. It is afterall future when becomes present is going to value a company appropriately at that time – Whereas promoters could very well have some other thing in mind than what I am thinking, what I am doing is making certain logical assumptions and securing my downsides by doing a thorough homework – else is upto promoters to execute and if they don’t, they will be the major looser since they own 74.16 % shareholding and I have not seen many companies with such a high promoter holding faltering in execution.\nThis is my personal point of view on which I have based my investment decision and I can be completely wrong in my point of view. Here, I have not tried to convince anyone regarding my hypothesis – please don’t take it that way — its just I have presented my point of view while respecting others’ point of view.\nRgds.\nDiscl. – Invested\nNote – This is part of a general discussion and not any sort of recommendation of any kind.','Nov 30, 2016 4:10 pm'),(4416,372,667,'Camphor & Allied AGM Key Takeaways for members’ Ref. -\n(1)\nArofine details :\nIts into high value low volume products.\nProduces 200 out of total 3000-3500 of such products in existence.\nMargins around 18%.\nAcquisition is mainly to reduce formulation cost.\nNo rev figures given.\n(2)\nOriental Aromatics FY16 numbers :\nOn everything on oriental they said they have not audited the results so cannot give numbers.\nBut off record they said 115-120cr topline and arond 14-15% margin (not sure about margin they just noded when someone put this number to them).\nOriental has grown by 15% historically for last 4-5 yrs. they expect to maintain same rate in next year and going forward.\n80 % revenue comes from Fragrance and 20 % from Flavours.\n90 % domestic revenue and 10 % Export.\nIn Fragrance clients are like Godrej, Nirma, Dabur, Bajaj, Keo Karpin.\nIn Flavours clients are like Pfizer, Abbott, Wockhardt.\n(3)\nCAPEX Plans :\nCapex 40cr is for Vadodra plant.

Its like Dabur or Godrej trading at discount to SH Kelkar or packaging companies like TCPL or Hitech Plast trading at a premium to their key clientle which to me is completely irrational and is exactly what is going to happen with CAP post merger in Q4FY17.\nTo me, post merger, CAP’s valuation lies in between valuation commanded by Privi & SH Kelkar – wherein it has to trade at slight premium to Privi but at a significant discount to SHK. Quantification of ‘significant discount to SHK’ will purely depend on margins of F&F Blends business which is getting merged, asto how quickly CAP can improve its margins of Blends segment post merger. But, this is my personal thinking and I can be completely wrong.\nAccording to my experience in capital markets, each company :\n– which has strong positioning in its operational segment (wherein it is in Top 5 in each segment),\n– its key operational segments are likely to exhibit strong p.a. growth in double digits or high single digits in foreseeable future,\n– its scale of operation is approaching 500 cr. p.a.\n– its key senior management/promoters (MD & Jt. MD) are in their 40s and 30s age group,\n– its management is active and taking right steps to try to improve topline growth as well as profitability margins of the business,\n– has strong legacy behind it – not only listed CAP has a history of existence of 5 Decades – 55 Long Years but, the entity which is getting merged – Oriental Aromatics – has even a longer history of existence of 6 Decades – 61 Long Years,\nsuch companies normally go through a wealth-creation cycle and with 0 % institutional holding, low equity capital with nil dilution history, thinly traded nature of company’s stock, only-BSE listing, promoter holding getting enhanced to maximum near 75 % mark and no other business interest of promoter apart from listed entity — we seem to be probably at the first stage of such wealth-creation cycle.\n– Now, such wealth creation cycles can be multi-year and initiation or progression pace of actual significant quantum of wealth creation by the company could purely depend on how quickly the further steps management takes — it could initiate in 6 months, 1 year or might take longer than 2 years. Key in such cycles is protecting downsides and waiting for upsides and riding the main portion of upsides with patience.\n– With CAP’s business post merger generating 35-40 cr. cash per year from operations and its 25 % of the business enjoying Gross_Asset turns of 4.5-5x and remaining 75 % business enjoying Gross_Asset turns of 2.5-3x and current capacity utilisation at ~60-65 %, one can just make his own calculation and arrive at the downsides and let the markets decide on the upsides.\nRgds.\nDiscl. - Invested in Camphor & Allied Products Ltd.','Dec 7, 2016 12:20 pm'),(4422,372,1171,'@Mahesh any other listed player apart from CAMPHOR N SH KELKAR?','Dec 12, 2016 12:50 pm'),(4423,372,667,'@sumitjain0014\nIn F&F blends space only two players will be listed in India — CAP and SH Kelkar …MNCs like IFF and Givaudan are listed in international markets\nIn pure play aroma chemical space apart from CAP, Fairchem Specialty (Adi Fine-Privi Organics) is listed n India\nIn synthetic camphor space apart from CAP, Mangalam organics and Kanchi karpooram are listed in India\nRgds.','Dec 12, 2016 2:25 pm'),(4424,372,1171,'just some rough calculation not a recommendation not any target …\nDisclosure not invested.\n@mahesh shah','Dec 12, 2016 4:05 pm'),(4425,372,308,'Hi,\nThe revised equity of 62.4 lakh shares considered in the calculation is promoters equity.

Company has not increase the revenue because of volatile market\nIn last year and a half year company has directed its attention towards VW group and Renault Nissan and Mitsubishi groups are the two largest groups and there company hope to win lot of business from them last year and this year in fact some of the new plants which are coming up in Brazil and Morocco and other regions will be largely to also cater to these two people . In this year company is concerned for the VW and Renault than also company has increased its volume.\nCompany is winning new business even on the VLS side. On the India side company is already aligned with all the, 90% of business is two wheeler market and this business for company is growing.\nCompany is one of the largest players with Bajaj, Honda, Hero, Yamaha, Royal Enfield, and now recently even TVS Motors also started. and with a whole new range of new portfolio including some of the newer products which company is entering like catalyst for BS VI and the electronic fuel injection systems, which is additional revenue stream for company , also the more penetration of LED lamps, more of electronic instrument clusters, and going forward company is also working on power train , on the motor side and once the EVs also come in to the mark. Company is very sticky in two wheeler space in India which is one-third of company business. So company is on track to achieve target of revenue of 20,000 Cr in next four years\nWhat will be the sustainable margin going forward ?\nIn India side in the first six month company margins have expanded and there is a lot of work happening on the manufacturing efficiency side, on the purchasing side, and purchase side obviously because when volume grows than one get better purchasing efficiencies and of course with revenue growth one is absorbing its fix cost in a much better way which is the biggest driver of profitability. In Q2 company is at 12.1 % EBITDA on India business and going forward company will do well in India business.\nOn the VLS side company have some head winds with some of company big customer like JLR especially because of the Brexit issues and also because of the China-US trade wars, China market has actually also gone down.\nCompany also have some headwind from Ford also and also PSA has been flat for company. But company grown in VW and Renault so because the revenues have not grown up to expectations that has impacted margins to some extent\nIn Czech operations also company have some operational issues but from September this year company have seen a lot of improvement in Czech operation in company biggest plant which is in Moravia region so company will now see better results in the Czech operations which are the biggest operations for company in VLS business, that is the biggest region for company today.\nDid Q2 margins were the bottom end and from here company would see improvement ?\nYes company will do better on the margins going forward in VLS.\nHow company will cover the gap of margin with top players ?\nAll bigger competitors have scale so their margins are better and company scale is lower. Now after IndAS 115 accounting also earlier company was doing it within a two year time frame at the time of SOP business but all other competitors like Valeo , Hella etc are doing it on over the life the life of the program. , which is over may be at least five years. By following that program today company overall margin have grown in VLS also because now after the second quarter company is aligned with the global players. So they are accounting for it. Now, what has happened is that with this accounting change, it has been positive for company but going forward it will all normalize, so basically company need volume growth, with new growth and with just stable kind of operational efficiencies and now what is happening in India will also happen in VLS.\nWhat is the breaks up of revenue from top six customers compare to last year same quarter ?\nCustomer A was 24.3% compared to 22.5% this year; customer B last year was 16.5, now it is 22.2; customer C was 15.7 last year, marginally improved to 15.9; customer D was 12% last year, it has gone down to 6.1% this year; customer E which was the fifth customer last year was 8.4, now it is 7.7; and customer F last year was 8.5, now it is 12.5.\nWhat will be the factor that will not continue in Q3 on margin side ?\nCompany investing in new capacity because company have won incremental business so that is driving the growth of VLS. Company is on track to reach its organic growth for 2021 and 2022 for VLS so because of this organic growth company is building new plant. Company is building Morocco , Brazil and company have now accelerated the pace for this new plant so initially Morocco was supposed to start in April which is now getting start February. Company have pass the first quality audit and now producing the first pieces and now company is in full validation with first customer.\nIn Brazil company was supposed to start in March but now company have secured the start of production for January and company is trying to produce the first part delivered to the customer already in December this year. So this upsides are adding additional cost which company was not having in last year and as soon as company start delivering from these new plants company will get benefit from the revenue that they will be generating, so that is one part to improve the margin on the short-term.\nCompany has put a new leadership in plants and with their push company have been able to reduce the labour number and direct labour. Company have shown decrease in September and will be showing another decrease in October and now in November for the third month company will show another decrease so this is showing that company is in right lane and this will translate in better numbers on company bottom line. so this c ombination of labor reduction, insourcing in addition to this cars that has well stabilized is what is showing the stability of the actions that company have put in place and will impact the margin of VLS.\nWill the EBITDA improvement will start seeing from FY20 onwards ?\nCompany have seen improvement in EBITDA, also in VLS from third quarter onwards, It will start happening because till the last quarter company were e like kind of really on the process of turning around. In September, company have turn around and now company will see better number from Czech plant where the major issues were from an operations angle, but yes, there are concerns on the revenue, Company is still growing on the revenues so those revenues will be there for company and because of the improvement in the Czech facility company will see better margins. but yes, one thing is still there that China, the revenues are still lower than budget when it comes in Europe and in China, that is something company not know because till these trade agreements happened between the US and China that is the major one or till like say between US and Europe also trade agreement needs to happen, so unless some of these trade things kind of materialize. Sale will increase in VLS also and company will see margin improvement.\nHow much program company had won last year and first half a nd how it will play out going forward ? what will drive the VLS business apart from the new program organically like adoption of LED and metrics LED in those whole process ?\nCompany had launched 140 programs last year world wide. Issue was company have significant amount of program that company launched in the same facility in Czech Republic, So company will balance the program going forward with Morocco plant so that company will not have all the programs starting at the same time in the same geographic location.\nGoing forward in terms of margin improvement in addition to the short-term activities that company is having and that will impact short-term in the next quarter. Company have signed a JV agreement for electronics with a company Elba in Romania and it is company target to start producing it own electronics. Today company have the capacity to fully design electronics , but company also send electronics to EMS company. With the joint venture company is able to obtain significant portion of the manufacturing, unlike this company is able to generate significant savings. According to the feasibility studies company is able to reduce 10 % price of electronics compared to external purchase price from own EMS. In addition, this joint-venture will contribute also to the profit of company so this is a significant step for company and this will be another step towards improving the profitability on the margin of business.\nIn Europe many players are going for EV vehicles so does company have any program for that ?\nCompany is focusing on the specific segment of the industry. Company is trying to avoid the segments with lot of technology content, but low volume which is very consuming, draining in terms of engineering resources. Company is trying to avoid the segment of very high volume, but no technology content where there is more players and also more pressure on the margin . Company is focusing on the segments with volume and technology. A good example are the two main customers that are rising company growth right now, the Volkswagen group and Renault Nissan and Mitsubishi group.\nReason for this step is because for example last year Renault had produced 10.4 million vehicles. they had announced already that by 2021 they would produce 14 million vehicles. They have announced also that every Renault branded vehicle will have full LED headlamps, so this is the kind of customers company want.\nComing of ADB technology is a big announcement that was legal in Europe until now is becoming legal also in North America in the US. This is a big news for industry because company will be able to increase the technology content of the product that company is selling in US as early as next year. Company have already started with its main customers in North America. Today company have products with ADB content , ADB technology.\nCompany has continue to deploy this growth strategy, so company worked again with VW, with Renault but also in China. In China company have won significant new businesses with Shanghai Volkswagen, SVW. This customer were in the past and these are customers that did very well in the same ones wherever want to play. In China, these are customers that are growing, that are leaders in their business, so they bring volumes and they bring technology.\nCompany has also win a new launch on Greely vehicles , Greely is the fastest growing car manufacturer in China. They are producing their first vehicle in Europe and they have chosen Varroc for their launch with specific technology, very advanced technology that company had patented and only one to able to deliver to market. so these are good signs that this strategy is working that the customer are receptive to company and continue to trust company.\nWhat is the company strategy to win project from Japanese or Korean players in VLS business ?\nIn Korea, there are two strong lighting companies already, but company is very close to Hyundai because company is bringing foot print to Hyundai that their current supplier do not necessarily have. Right now company acquisition in Turkey is helping Hyundai in Turkey. With company positioning in India in the South in Chennai company is able to ship of them in the right location in India.\nWith new plant in Brazil and there are no right now supplier in Brazil, they are forced to import the lighting, so with this new footprint of company , company is becoming more important for Hyundai. Company is very close to enter in Hyundai.\nCompany have done a tech show recently in Hyundai . Company has also open a small office in Korea where company have representative that is helping to link and navigate better the Hyundai purchasing organization that company is familiar with. He is a former Hyundai key purchasing executive, so he has the right connection as well and he is helping company to develop and grow the momentum.\nOn Japan Side company have already won a program from Nissan, so that has been a start, the part of Renault-Nissan group, so Nissan company had already start a platform where there are Japanese OEM and also company have some interest from some other Japanese OEMs. Company has also open a office in Japan and Japanese are also big players in the global market.\nCompany have to be with the Korean and the Japanese also because they together control at least 20% to 25% of the total car market.\nK indly elaborate on the electronic fuel injection system and catalytic convertor ?\nThis is for the India business on the two wheeler side, so for two wheeler today company have huge product range of 16 types of products across three divisions in India , polymer , electrical , electronic and metallic. Now, because of the new emission regulations, this gives company opportunity to be also because of the new BS VI from April 1, 2020, this has given an opportunity to be also a player in some of these high technology items like the electronic fuel injection, which are high cost items with lot of electronics in it and here company have tied up with an Italian company and already won a business with one of the large two wheeler OEMs in India. Similarly, in the catalytic front also because for the BS VI, company have also won programs on the BS VI catalyst front, so these are some new products which company have entered which will add to revenue stream going forward. Today , it is not part of company revenue stream, but going forward these two products will add to revenue stream.\nHow many CAPEX does company have in next three years ?\n800-1000 Cr every year to be able to reach that kind of objective YOY and reach 20,000 Cr vision.\nWhere will be the whole CAPEX be utilized ?\nCapacity expansion, new plants these kind of things, also for some new products, also some capacity in the electronics also company is setting up a JV abroad. There will be further electronics because there is more and more electronics in products now, so company is also putting a world class electronics facility in Chakan in Pune, so all these future things which are coming in global market place of company and two wheelers.\nWhat kind of debt equity ratio is comfortable for company ?\nCompany will not cross 1:1\nKindly give the composition in the VLS, what is halogen versus the LED?\nCompany is in range of 47 % of LED penetration for the quarter. There is still a little bit of a HID and the remaining halogen technology, but it varies also between headlamp and rear lamp. Now, in terms of rear lamp technology, more than 60% of LED penetration and going forward, every new rear lamp that company is developing has some kind of LED content. Very interesting is that for the many driven in Europe by the new emission norm. Every OEM knows he is pushing to have more LED content on the front lighting. By implementing full LED lighting on the front, they are able to get credit of 1 g of CO2 per kilometer which is significant for them because everybody has been struggling in Europe to reach this emission technology, so for example recently, with company customer Ford, company is in the process of switching the Fiesta and Focus that are smaller cars, so historically with more halogen content, company is switching to full LED content, so this is a very good opportunity for company and company will start to see this incremental revenue and incremental margin as early as next fiscal year, so company is accelerating the deployment.\nWhat was the revenue between electric vehicles and the diesel engine vehicles in VLS?\nLast year company had 21 % of the electric vehicle lighting market, number one position was having 22 %. So company is definitely a leader in the electric lighting vehicle. In this quarter in electric vehicles company is close to 19 % to 20 % of revenue of VLS.\nWith respect to domestic market in the India business, Which are the particular segments for example polymer or metallic which has grown significantly in this Q2 FY19 ?\nCompany have grown significantly across board because for the reason that 50% of revenues in India come from Bajaj and with Bajaj across all product company have e a significant share of business and they have been pretty aggressive in the market place in this year. So respect to that company have grown very well across segments and also with the other customers whether it is with Honda, with Royal Enfield even with Hero and with also the other customers also especially in the first quarter the growth was more, it has slowdown a little bit in the second quarter, but fortunately for company major customer has grown much faster than the rest of the players and to grab market share, that has really helped company to grow across all segments, across all divisions , product segments also .\nWill company maintain it statement of increasing margin by 150 BPS at the end of year ?\nIn second quarter compare to last year company have already achieved that 150 BPS increase because EBITDA is 12 and last year and last year company was probably at about 10.5% to 10.6% or something as a whole on a full-year basis and this year already the second quarter is 12 % EBITDA. So company have actually crossed that in the second quarter itself and company is hoping that it is able to sustain till the end of the year.\nWhat happen to FCA why it decline more than 40 % on YOY basis ?\nIt is company interior plastic business that company keep referring to in North America was an FCA business , that was the interior, the console for the Dodger van. Company decided last year that was rising for company to exit the business and this way on the gap in terms of revenue compare to last year in the specific business , the interior business.\nGoing forward it will be stable there will not be any increase or decrease.\nWhat about Renault , is it classified in others ?\nRight now Renault is very small with company , yes it is inside the others and then in next three years they will be in top three customers of VLS .\nThere is 4 % decline in Euro terms , has that been a relatively bigger decline because since Renault is growing, will there be other customers which has reported a bigger decline in others?\nIn others, the impact that company have seen specifically in the last quarter is mainly driven by China. China was volatile the last quarter, company have seen decrease notably from company local customers like Shanghai Ford for example. The good thing in China is right now government has decided to give some incentive to the new car buyers to divide by two the tax that is on new vehicles, so from that there is a boost in car sales. All the actors in the automotive industry, company is following it very closely and hope that this time the incentive will work again.\nI n India business what is the kind of out of 16 products how much company supply to Hero and Honda , any development in first half of the year ?\nWith Honda, there has been no increase except for the fact that some of the new products company got into like instrument clusters, company have seen now the volumes coming in this year. Now, presently company is in discussion with three other products with them, today company supply six products to them today to Honda , so company will be discussing three more products with them that is something which will be another maybe six to seven months to materialize because this will be post April 2020 when the new norms kick in, so that is something company is in discussion . Company should see attraction of at least two or three products by the end of this year.\nIn Hero, company will be starting the lighting facility for them in Halol this year and this month it starts the production, so that is more about to start with a million sets for vehicle sets for them, so that is after painting business, this is a second product company got into them. Company is in discussion already for another five or six products with Hero and that is something which is close to finalize, a lot of these are close to finalization within the next three to four months. So company will have some wins within the next three to four months with Hero .\nWhat would be company potential investment in Romania that Varroc would have to invest ?\nRomania JV, the investment will be in a gradual manner so initially company is envisaging a total investment of 2 million Euros out of which about 70% company will be putting in and JV partners will put in the balance 30% and over the next 12 to 18 months as company step up the capacity in the range of product , investments will go up, but overall company expect about 100% investment in the JV would be around 12 million Euros or thereabouts, out of that 70% will be done by company.\nIn how many time company will scale up to 12 million Euros ?\nNext 12 to 18 months, up to year-and-a-half depending on how quickly company is able to scale up.\nIn a year time company want to start a SOP but company is just saying on the safe the total investment is anyway about 12 million, of which 70% is company share which is part of company CAPEX plan.\nIn electronic JVs , what is the share of electronics as a total cost of lighting today?\nIncluding LEDs as part of electronics because they are electronic components, It is coming closer to 40% today of total purchasing amount. JV will be doing LED and PCB assembly . So company will take the different electronic components including the LEDs and then assemble them on PCB boards, so this is closer to 15-20 % of total purchasing amount .\nDoes company will only manufacture 30 % of the electronics requirement in house ?\nYes\nWhat will be the revenue share of the Turkey company which was acquired and the margin share of the Quarter-2 figures?\nOn the average revenue are about 2 to 2.5 million Euros, company have to pull out the extact numbers , but it is about 2 to 2.5 million Euros a month company do and the EBITDA there is high in that business, but revenues are at the moment small 8 to 9 million for the quarter was the revenues from Turkey.\nDid company have won any program under ADB technology and surface LED technology ?\nIn ADB company have already similar vehicles running on the ADB technology. For surface LED company have won first product already and company is very close to win the second one right now.','Jan 20, 2019 11:31 pm'),(4432,375,681,'It’s a very good company. Good management.

Quite commendable, seeing what all those Goliaths puts in and gets out!\nThe company attained direct cost breakeven level as per schedule, could be EBIDTA positive over next 2 quarters which is quite a deal.\nThey are continuously strengthening the business model to reduce the return rate to about 20-25% from current 35%. They brought 10000 pin codes into prepaid mode and having an order cancellation policy by creating a bad customer database (which is now 50000 strong).\nRobust, investor friendly management at the helm, now with a vision and clear road map, admiring and inspired by Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos. (I see the top management team of LatestOne.com 11 holding 10% of its equity as a big positive).\nIts promoter Palem Srikanth Reddy (PSR - as famously known in AP) has deep logistics background & ability / history of building companies from scratch (involving in all aspects of business, building a strong second level management team & giving perpetuity to business model) & later selling out at much higher valuations.\nWe witnessed that in Four Soft.\nHe also done that in Emery Worldwide India Pvt Ltd (an air cargo specialist – now acquired by UPS) where he was the cofounder and MD btw 1996 – 2000.\nHe was also served as the Logistics Manager at Hewlett Packard, Singapore btw 1989 – 94, where he was credited with improvement of processes by implementation of direct order processing and direct delivery systems with the end customers.\nSo, though he seems a stranger to ecom, his strategies would be driven by his core competency – logistics, which can make or break an ecom co. Also there is cause to believe that he will dilute stack at higher valuations.\nIt’s funny to see our governing laws are so trivial that blames PSR for unduly gaining 0.5 cr – somebody who generously distributed 170-180 cr to shareholders. That too when he was having only 24% promoter stack. Says a lot about his governance standards!\nCurrently I know many renowned value investors are turning positive and taking positions in this stock (unfortunately, I can’t disclose the names).\nBut seeing at SHP, many marquee investors already took stack at much higher valuations:\n• Ashish Dhawan increased his stake by taking preferential allotment at 210 per share\n• Erstwhile Chairman of Singapore Telecom and Singapore Airlines is a shareholder of Palred\n• Founder of Alliance Capital and Rothschild Ventures too is a shareholder.\nEarlier the company raised funds at about 200 cr valuations in the recent preferential allotments.\nAnd now the company proposing another round of preferential issues to raise fund on forthcoming Board meet on 13.3.2017. I’m expecting the valuations will be higher than previous rounds.\nAnd another huge positive development is the company started B2B portal – appointing 1000 dealers per month and has plans to add 25000 by 2017-18. Will lead to high volumes (lower margins though), lower returns, increase average order size plus reduce warehouse and logistics cost per order.\nAgain, I’m not much interested in number crunching but getting the big picture right.\nIn the esoteric world of ecom valuations (which so far defied the law of gravity but now giving up), with a MCAP 90 CR, healthy balance sheet with cash, Palred Tech looks quite attractive & worthy punt with multibagger potentials.','Mar 7, 2017 7:36 pm'),(4492,295,531,'Palred Technologies is a turn around stroy.\nIt’s Ptron brand is doing extremely well.

This is also the year when they started selling “Brass accessories” which led to a jump in Sales.\n2.) Sale of land in Islampur - I must admit I was quite surprised to see this. Even though growth has been stagnant over the past couple of years it was sort of reassuring to see that they have land which could potentially be used for expansion.\nOne explanation for this could be that at their existing factory they have an installed capacity of 45L units per annum (as mentioned in the FY11 AR) which means that they only use about 50% of that on a regular basis.\n3.) Management remuneration - couple of years that stood out for me were FY12-14. Company was in need of funds because of increasing working capital and capex requirements. Company stopped the dividends and MD’s salary reduced by 50% to 6L p.a. for these 3 years. No cut was made to the COO and CFO salaries.\nThis to me highlights the integrity of the promoters and the fact that they think highly of their employees. Also shows that they don’t consider the company to be a cash cow for themselves, but think of it as a long term asset.\nThey promptly resumed the dividends in FY13 once the crunch was over.\nFY20 has seen a spike in MD’s salary however.
