We can cover every PIN code of the country through our intricate hub and spoke model, which multiplies the geographies we cover through the above branch offices. Prospectus extract on the background of the company: Our Company was earlier engaged in the business of providing insurance services and human resource solutions provider. During FY 2015 we recorded Nil revenues since our erstwhile promoters were preoccupied in their other ventures. During FY 2016 we received a single order from Reliance Life Insurance Company Limited. They were our single client during FY 2016. On July 26, 2016 our Promoter, Pankaj Vyas, took over the management and control our Company by acquiring then existing 100% paid-up equity share capital of our Company from our erstwhile promoter CRP Risk Management Limited. Post this change our company was transformed into a Company is engaged in the business of Background Screening (also known as BGC - Background Check) and Due Diligence. Core focus areas:  BGC Corporates:  Background screening of employees On-boarding processes Exit Management Employee support service  Checks conducted by the company:  Education Employment Criminal Identity Database and media Residential Reference Credit check Drug test Psychometric test  BGC Individual:  Indias first B2C background screening product Allows individuals to self-certify their CVs Shifts onus of responsibililty of clean resumes from employer to employee  Due Diligence:  Due diligence for Senior Management hires Due diligence for partners / suppliers Due diligence for investments KYC services  Competitive strengths:  Wide Range of Services National player, with global footprint Process: ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified Focus on long term revenue stream  Business Strategy:  Extension of target client segments Expansion of service and geographical offerings Use of SecUR Number to redefine the market space Strong Industry vertical based focus  What gives confidence on their abilities is the kind of clientele that they have:  SecUR number - can be a decent opportunity in future, if they scale up big time (website): \'More That 30% Of Candidates Lie On Their Resumes About Past Employment Details, Salary, Residential Address Or Criminal Record An Inflated CV Causes Damage To Your Bottom Line, Month-On-Month, While The Candidate Is Still In The System One Wrong Hire Can Tarnish The Work-Place, Its Productivity, And The Entire Companys Reputation When, on an average, there are 118 candidates applying for one vacancy, a pre-verified resume showcasing the authenticity of the candidates claims is a breath of fresh air. Add to that the fact that background screening in India is a trend that is catching on, especially in start-ups for whom valuations mean life or death. Any HR will attest to the value of a pre-verified resume and the ease it brings to the hiring process.The Secur Number is a 10 digit code which enables this benefit by providing a comprehensive verification report that meets industry benchmarks for background checks. Accessible online, this report will aid one in going the extra mile with their prospective employer by showcasing ones integrity. The employer can then easily access the report with the help of the 10 digit number and download all the authentication proofs in the report.

Technology - Symphony 3.0 (prospectus): Currently we are using the software SYMPHONY 3.0 which is a proprietary integrated workflow software of CRP Risk Management Limited that seamlessly directs, tracks and controls the flow of work at SecUR. It is built on a Java Platform, and offers real-time, online movement of processes, as well as information. Symphony 3.0 has been audited and approved by most of our large IT clients from a n information security perspective. We have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding dated August 28, 2017 with CRP Risk Management Limited for buying the SYMPHONY 3.0 Software along with its database for an aggregate consideration of 797.03 Lakhs. CRP Risk Management Limited had developed in-house workflow software, which is currently in its version 3.0, named Symphony. This JAVA-based plat form is the essential glue which holds together all the operational delivery processes, and ensures that these processes deliver the promised output to the client. There is a tremendous amount of data which is stored in Symphony 3.0. This is the result of all data being accumulated over a period of close to 10 years, as part of the BGC process being delivered by CRP to its clients. Also, because of the inherent design of the Symphony architecture, the database needs to be acquired in tandem with the software application, as it cannot be extracted from the software. The key components of this database structure are briefly described below: Education data accumulated over 10 years: Over the past 10 years, as a systematic and thorough effort, the CRP team had accumulated close to 3 crore education records which have been made part of the Symphony database. These education records include a lot of education record archives from colleges and Universities across the country, which have been acquired and digitized with a lot of effort, and at great expense. On a regular basis, the Operational delivery team accesses this data for conducting education checks, as this process is online (and hence faster), and at no incremental transaction cost. Re-creating this database will not just be cumbersome and expensive. Symphony 3.0 is also home to another key component of our business IP: All the database of educational institutes  colleges, universities, training institutes, schools  along with the process of verifying education records from them is stored in the form of a Master Database in Symphony. This Master Database extends to all the corporates and employers, who have ever been contacted, along with the detailed process of these employers provide verifications. (Detailed information about the software can be found in the prospectus). Need for background check (website): Employee related frauds such as inflated salary slips, exaggerated past designations and misleading academic history can cause damage to the bottom-line month on month while the employee is still in the system. Criminal history, questionable political affiliations and a negative personality can  cause severe damage to a companys reputation and future earning potential. Therefore, it is imperative that companies safeguard themselves by performing background checks on all hires.

Short history but company looks decently placed in an interesting industry. Low base, size of opportunity large and niche product offering. 1QFY18 revenues have been more than half of FY17 revenues. At this pace they might conservatively exceed revenues of 15cr and PAT of 3cr for FY18. However, I am looking at this more from a very long term horizon. It is close to 120cr mcap right now. I believe EBITDA margins on a steady state basis can be 25-30%. Valuations - very difficult to assess for a small company with such a short history - so will leave it upto you to judge.  Summary of financials (INR lakhs):  Financials.png760157 16.4 KB  Risks/Concerns:  Company started operations recently hence has a short history of performance. Company still small in terms of revenue. One of the objects of IPO was to buy out Symphony 3.0 software. Any slowdown, tepid growth in hiring / human capital across industries. Receivables are high. Typical risks associated with SME companies - liquidity is low, lot size is high and others.  All the above details have been taken from public material, largely their prospectus, website. PS: My personal view is given the low base, large opportunity size and niche product offering, it is a play on jobs growth and ever increasing jugaadisation.

Well and good. But I do not think police in India is asking for AADHAR from criminals yet. So it cannot do a criminal verification. In future employers may be able to do employment duration verification and even education verification also. However, AADHAR does not know about my resume yet so that verification it cannot do. Also, AADHAR is not yet able to do social media verification viz Linkedin recommendations, Udemy training etc. Now if I review the list of checks conducted by the company, AADHAR actually does have an impact today or in future.  Education --> will be impacted by AADHAR, already I know schools asking for AADHAR to issue ID cards Employment --> will be impacted by AADHAR Criminal --> Not sure Identity --> already impacted by AADHAR Database and media --> Is this social? Residential --> AADHAR impacted Reference --> Nope Credit check --> AADHAR impacted Drug test --> Possible to link with AADHAR Psychometric test --> Not impacted  So in my opinion, several items are getting impacted by AADHAR in not so distant future or are already impacted.

My thought process is that we had PAN/DLs etc which are similar to Aadhaar in many ways except that these dont have bio metrics. Bank Accounts and Many Insurance policies are also linked with PAN. But does that enable companies to rely on any of these for background verification ? No, I guess. As someone rightly pointed out criminal/Employment/Current Address etc cant be relied solely on Aadhaar. Even for address verification how can someone rely on Aadhaar as people do change places and Aadhaar address may or may not be updated. Banks are not giving loan just on the basis of AAdhaar, how can assume MNCs to rely on this while hiring their employees. On top of that , How difficult would it be for some to get multiple Aadhaars ? (A little old news but highlights the risk http://indianexpress.com/article/trending/man-arrested-for-getting-aadhar-card-made-for-dog/) SecUR does detailed background check and once that persons details are there in their database then next time if some other company approaches them for verification then they can do it much faster and cost to them would be much lower as they incurred while doing that first time. Scope for the BGC market IMHO is huge.  Companies does that for their employees Societies do it for new tenants Colleges do it for their students Common people can do this for their servants Going forward with online matrimony expanding, even parents can avail their services for the BGC of their would be son/daughter in law.  I had once called them just to check their charges per verification.

About 400m are in the informal sector which includes jobs also like farmers, farm labourers, daily wage workers.

Couple of observations, opportunity wise as others have mentioned it is quite huge as very few companies to my mind are doing proper (or any) background checks and this is something that will to my mind most definitely come into vogue in future with increasing incidents of fraud, especially given the once bitten twice shy phenomenon. The opportunities for operating leverage are huge, essentially cost will only be the software (which is already largely done) and the people. Given that this is broadly a startup they can probably handle a much larger turnover with less than proportionate increase in costs. Also there can be opportunities for global scaling up if you develop/ buy databases there or partner with existing cos in that space for outsourcing. There would be a good amount of cost arbitrage i assume. In that context Authbridge whom @jatin had linked seems to be a global player with 140 countries presence, obviously it has a 11 year start on Secur having commenced operations in 2005 but shows you the chance is there. Does anyone know anything more about Authbridge or any other player in the industry?  Might give an idea of how much of the market is already penetrated.

The companys business sustainability going into the future stands on these 3pillars of strength. Capacity addition to drive profitability growth The company is in the process of expanding capacity at its Vadodra Plant. The company is adding a new line of 60,000MT of BOPP films & another line of 7,200MT of metalizer films .This expansion entails a capex of~ 200crs .The capex will be funded through a mix of 80:20 debt to internal accruals. This expansion will boost total capacity of BOPPfilms by ~44% taking total capacity of BOPPfilms to 196,000MT. While for the metalizer films this expansion will boost capacity by~48% taking total capacity to22,200MT. The expanded capacities are expected to be commissioned by the end of FY17. Meaningful ramp up of these capacities is expected during the course of FY18. At peak capacity utilisation the newline can add~500crs.to the topline.The newline being added is of state of the art technology which will enable the company to reduce cost of production per kg for it films and hence boost profitability. The newline has an extended width of 10.4mtrs.vs.the maximum width of 8.7mtrs available in India. This feature of the newline will enable the company to reduce wastage a swellas power consumption during production. The company expects the newline to consume30% lesspower vs. its average consumption on existinglines. We believe the newline will help add to the profitable growth of the company for next two years.

Investing in R&D to find new business opportunities: With the collective R&D experience of over 100 person years the company is well ahead of its peers in innovation cycle. It was first in the thermal lamination films and first BOPP player to do direct film coating. Company is spending 0.4% of sales on R&D.

Thanks @chiragjain1976  for initiating a thread about Cosmo Films. I am tracking and holding Cosmo for a year now. From what I have observed, the management is honest, does walk the talk, and since Pankaj Poddar joined, the company seems to be doing all the right things. The dividend yield for last year was around 2.5%. While there is no doubt that the BOPP films consumption is going to grow in India for the next few years, I have two reservations that I closely monitor, it would be much helpful to know your view on it as well.   Right now there is over capacity in the industry as pointed out in one of the posts.   As you rightly pointed out, the cost of raw materials is passed on to the customer. So the drop in prices of crude oil (which is the main raw material for Polypropelene) will reduce the cost of raw materials and this advantage is passed on to the customer and vice versa. But in realty the company performed better when the crude is down for the past three years. This question was asked in their Q1FY17 earnings call. This was the reply from management    So there is no direct correlation with crude?. Answer is no. If you really see the crude has fallen from $120 to $45 which is more than 65-70% reduction. But if you talk about polypropylene prices, the peak polypropylene prices were like $1500-1550 and it is still sitting at $1050 as on date, which is a drop of 30-35%. But on an average what people normally try and predict is that the change in oil price, 50% of that normally gets passed onto polypropylene over a period but the simple reason that polypropylene is not a direct derivative of oil. There are in between 2-3 stages before oil becomes polypropylene. So at a broad level you can say that whatever is the percentage change in oil, polypropylene price may change by half of it but I am not an expert on the matter.  So the falling/increasing prices of crude will definitely affect the cost of raw materials.But how well this cost is cascaded to the customer is still a gray area for me and if the company is in a position to dictate the changes in prices without losing customers as there are also other players like Jindal Poly Films in the industry.

Also management pedigree looks decent. I had evaluated the financials for last 10 years from screener and going through last 2 annual reports; Few Observations:  Sales growth was about 13% CAGR for last 10 years with operating profits in the range of 15% (Mar 08) to 5%(Mar 14). Growth was funded by capacity expansions all along (which should be the case) However, Profits for the last 10 years were not sufficient to fund expansion as Capex in these years was about twice the net profits. Hence debt / equity levels are consistently in the range of 1.6x to 1.0x. ROE good in years when Crude prices are low and had fallen in years when Crude price rises. In the last AR management had hinted that Operating margins are going to be stable at current levels 11%-12% due to cost optimization initiatives undertaken. (Not sure how, as there is cost plus component for its products?) Debt is expected to go up again due to ongoing expansions, as mentioned by the management in the AR. Management is shareholder friendly as always maintained dividend payout of 25% to 30%. Last year they paid highest dividend in their history.  Based on reading so far, it appears that business is competitive, highly dependent on Crude prices for margins and growth is dependent on expansions, which always requires external sources of capital (cant be funded by profits). Management is good aspect of this Company, that could be the reason that it trades at premium as compared to Jindal Polyfilms (Jindal have its own share of Issues). a) Current expansion is in the differentiated product along with more efficient plant. b) Market leader in Value added Products, Focus on increasing revenue from value added products  from 50% to 60%. c) Cost rationalization are already done, although shows management commitment and focus on cost control measures but beyond a point cant add to margins. Not sure how much margin expansion due to above items. Based on above I feels its best to invest in such business when Crude prices are really very high as compared with current scenario, as high crude prices will suppress margins and business may be available at attractive valuations. In a scenario when Crude prices are set to increase, there are chances that margins may decline and consequently the share price.

BOPP and laminations have overcapacity globally and hence  suppliers like cosmos have very little bargaining power    From the annual report - Financial Year 2016 has been one of the best years in the history of Cosmo Films. Consolidated sales stood at Rs. 1,616 Cr representing an 8% growth in sales (not revenues). Furthermore, EBITDA rose approximately 80% to Rs. 197 Cr. During the year, we not only remained focused on driving cost efficiencies across our global operations but also implemented a number of marketing initiatives to increase the sales of higher margin products in specialty films. As a result of these relentless efforts, consolidated profit after tax expanded more than three times to Rs. 96 Cr. Our U.S. operations have also improved from last year as a result of several strategic initiatives taken. Strategic focus area for the company remains value added specialty films and we look forward to increase its share in future. Even though sales volumes (particularly overall specialty sales) grew, revenues declined as benefits from lower raw material prices were passed on to consumers. EBITDA on a consolidated basis is Rs. 196.84 Cr as against Rs. 110.31 Cr in F.Y. 2015, an increase of 78.4%. This includes benefits from a reduction in variable costs through several engineering initiatives. In particular, power cost and freight costs were optimised.

Moreover, mgmt has time and again said that they are increasing focus on specialty segment. This will be the next margin trigger. Along with, the new BOPP line is highly efficient, and would entail savings resulting in better margins. Another important thing is continuous improvement in their US Operations. Here is what mgmt said in August 2016 - \"We had an issue with our Asian subsidiary of Japan and Korea where the currency really went against us, where it was 80 yen to the dollar and it went up as high as 120 yen to the dollar and now it is back to 100 yen to the dollar which gives us a more productive base at least on the Asian side. So I certainly think that this quarter onwards if the currency movement is not as volatile, or we should do better in our Asian subsidiaries. Where the US is concerned, there have been one-off write-offs, there has been one-off some receipts which we got on the customs duty, but I can assure you that the US operation is much more under control. We have revamped the organisation, we have got the right processes in place and I must tell you this today that we are looking to expand US operations at least doubling the revenue in the next couple of years. We are going to invest there, we are going to spend more on processes, but I am fairly confident that in the next 24 months, you will see at least doubling of our revenues which will obviously mean a productive bottomline\".     kb_snn:   Only good thing is it is getting some tax benefits & there is some low cost capacity lined up .

Consolidated Revenue marginally declined by 2% from 1616 cr to 1580 cr. Consolidated PAT for FY17 was 89 cr down from 96 cr in FY16. Standalone PAT increased marginally 3% from 108 cr to 112 cr. Sales from Subsidiaries - US - Sales grew 6% tis eyar to 175cr. Losses reduced to 14 cr from 17 cr in FY16. Japan - Sales grew from 47 cr to 50 c. Though, PAT decreased from 1.42 cr to -.77 cr Korea - Sales reduce from 47 cr to 42 cr. Losses increased from 4 cr to 8 cr. So, subsidiaries are still bleeding big time here. Mgmt says they have attaind breakeven at operational level, but i do not see any improvement.  However, sales volume was up 5%. Consolidated net debt is now 589 cr, Up from 390 cr last year. Net debt to equity is 1.1 This mismatch (higher volumes, revenue decline) was caused due to lower prices of commodity films along with reduced RM prices. Margins were under pressure for most part of the second half (post November) due to demonetization. Lower tax outgo due as the company was able to avail tax deduction on the new investment in plants and machinery allowable under IT Act Investment allowance having an overall impact of 9.8 cr on its tax. Specialty sales of the company grew by 20% YOY. On consolidated basis, one time Forex losses in its Japan subsidiary impacted the bottomline. On domestic front, demonetization impacted it big time.   Company successfully mitigated these negatives to a large extent by increasing the share of value added films (speciality)   Overseas subsidiaries achieved break even at EBIDTA level in Q4 FY 17. Many new products were launched in the specialty segment this year. 10.4 m BOPP line which came online in Feb 2017, will be full operational (ramped up to full capacity by mid FY18). The new installed capacity is expected to add an additional 35-40% production volume in FY18. During FY17, capex done was 221 cr. In FY16, capex done was 84 cr. Also announced 36000 MT BOPET line to be commissioned during Q3 FY19 at a cost of 250 cr (mostly debt). (niche specialty products). Subsidiaries are there in Singapore, US, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Netherlands. Being closer to customer helps fetch better margins. CRM implemented this fiscal. Strong brand visibility initiatives taken during the year to boost exports.Increased from 612 cr to 638 cr. Strong focus on R&D. Special BOPP film for cement bags to increase moisture resistance. R&D expenses grew from 4 cr to 8.4 cr tis year.

Indian packaging industry has registered 15% CAGR growth in last 5 years. Strong momentum is expected to continue. India BOPP capacity is 570k MT, of which 80% is consumed domestically. Significant trends are driving rapid changhe due to increased presence of global multinational companies, consumer brand awareness, products with clean label messaging, increase in per capita income, urbanization, growing number of working women,. e-com per capita plastic consumption in India is 4.3 Kg. China is 6 Kg, Taiwan is 19 Kg. So, huge scope for growth. GST will benefit supply chain efficiency for FMCG companies resulting in cost reduction in terms of transportation. Reduction in cost will make goods cheaper, which is positive for packaging industry.  Key Risks -  RM price volatility - Usually a pass though, but with a lag Forex fluctuation - Hedges, but still a key risk Specialty becoming commodity - Increased competition in specialty segment  Balance Sheet, Working Capital  and Cash Flows -  Balance sheet has become more leverages this year with working capital rising big times by 115 cr (68 cr rise in receivables) + 47 cr rise in inventory. Hence, CFO reduced drastically from 245 cr last year to 30 cr this year.  This is a key point to ask, as to why inventories and receivables have rocketed in FY17. Also, i think debt fueled expansion would lead to problems later on. Currently debt/equity is okaish at 1.1, but would have liked them to generate better cash flows to fuel growth.

The management seems to sound over-optimistic and looks like theyre trying a bit too much or a bit overtly to create a good impression.

Is it because the business is good or are they trying to look good and pretty all the time? Some of them are convincing while some are not. For example, while talking about Direct Thermal Printable Films, these days I refuse to even take the Print receipt from Petrol Bunks. But theyve invested a lot in R&D of DPT Films to come up with a Printable Film that has a 5 year shelf-life of the print, since currently it fades too soon. (Besides, is this a slow industry or an industry undergoing rapid change?) Why do I need a 5 year shelf-life, if Im not even going to take the receipt because I get SMS and statements online? Are there any other applications of a DPT Film that the company will benefit out of like they said something about use in hospitals, wrap-arounds or used on wrists or something. Is DPT unique to them? As a Google search turns up only Cosmo Films. Is it important by size in volume, price, revenue and margins? Or is it something insignificant to be ignored? If its their own finding out of their R&D, should any of us ask if they have any patents in the next ConCall? Is a patent required for this or any other offering of theirs, if theyre from their own labs? Im way too ignorant of this field and I think this is the only company currently with good numbers. Do you also think their good numbers are a concern too due to the cyclical nature of their business? There seems to be some tailwinds for their business for the next couple of years at least.

I also feel GPIL has not got its due ( maybe biased as invested) given the walking the talk done by the management and strong de-leveraging done. Market cap has not increased even equal to the debt reduction done till now over last 3 years. If they can sell/get off from the solar power business or maybe demerge the same, that will be really good. Another co which seems to be a beneficiary with growth ahead is Sandur - would be good to get your thoughts/insight on the same (there is another thread for the same).

From what I remember 375 crore debt belongs to Godavari green, which will also be taken care of with the proposed divestment. Over a period of 5- 6 years the management has given most importance to the deleveraging exercise. They realized early on, that the high leverage is the biggest threat to their business and used every opportunity and good part of their profits to pare down debt. This deleveraging didnt start with the current commodity bull run that ensued after covid crisis, it started back in 17-18 when there was a small upcycle.

When we started, the feeling was that the co is doing few things right (huge scale up in captive iron ore production over last 5 yearsfrom about 3/4 lac ton pa to 15 lac ton pa) and the valuations were too cheap. Yet stock did nothing and fell by over 50% during covid times and earlier too. At that time it was more of a value-investing thing. However, in last 1 year or so, the way the co has de-leveraged, executed and walked the talk, it became very interesting. Plus they have been lucky on the super strong iron/pellet cycle and are making the most of it. I dont know the right way of valuing. In highlight later, todays prices maybe peak too if the iron ore/pellet price crash big time from here in coming times. So one needs to have own framework. @bimalb - it is a commodity co. but generally when a commodity label is give, nobody looks at the company. Even in commodities there are cos which are better most due to their integration and execution or perhaps lowest cost structure.

It is likely to be sold around those levels (Conservatively believe). the company will now be exporting all pellets that they produce as they have started production of high grade pellets which are in good demand currently and get premium pricing. Now that Godawari Green will be sold, GPIL becomes a solely focused steel company with clean balance sheet. GPIL was perceived to be a conglomerate because of this solar power plant (unrelated diversification - a management error); hence GPIL always traded cheaper. Legendary Fund Manager, Mr. Bharat Shah has stated - a conglomerate will most likely be valued at a multiple of its weak business as markets get confused when there are different business segments. But now there is a scope of re-rating. Management is rational and will undertake capex only with internal accruals (estimated free cash flows Rs600-800 cr per year based on normal steel cyclecurrently Rs1200 cr per year due to strong uptrend in steel) So i believe it should trade at an EV/EBITDA of 4-6 x of its Rs1000 cr estimated normalized EBITDA (current EBITDA run-rate is Rs2000cr per year). Now few sequence of events to follow would be:  Iron ore mining expansion (200 cr mining EBITDA additional will be generated) Expansion of billets, sponge (brownfield) Company becomes debt free and releases pledge (likely in Q1FY22) Next phase of greenfiled project/ acquisition of distressed assets  Also, now iron ore availability has improved a lot in Ardent due to the sourcing skills of the new partner. So expansion of pellet capacity at Ardent likely too Looks like exciting times. Steel cycle meanwhile looks sustainable with China going green, curbing capacities, phasing out export rebates.

References Energy  My valuation for GGEL: GGEL has earned revenue of Rs.88.66 Crores and net profit of Rs.14.28 Crores for the nine months ended on 31st December, 2020. If we extrapolate it for 12 months revenue comes at around 118.23 Cr. Average revenue had been around 90 to 100 Cr. If we consider annual revenue of Rs 90 Cr then we can safely assume EBIDTA of around Rs 80 Cr. The PPA with NTPC is for 25 years w.e.f 17/06/2013 i.e around 8 years gave already elapsed and remaining PPA period is around 17 years. So NPV of Rs  80 Cr per annum  for 17 years at discount rate of  10% comes to around Rs 640 Cr. (Debt of around Rs 350 Cr has to be netted off from this). I have considered terminal value as Nil The Company will become debt free not only on stand alone basis but also at group level. The Company will have cash of around Rs 200 Cr with this transaction. The future cash generated by the company will be free cash flow without any requirement of debt or interest payment and can be channelized for future growth without raising any debt i.e the future growth will be self sustainable and not debt funded which will be a great positive for this stock.

CRU Group principal analyst for steel, Erik Hedborg said reduced production in Tangshan, China had driven up prices. This was due to Chinas emissions crackdown in Tangshan.

The Company in their recent concals had advised that gradually they are shifting to high grade pellets and the CAPEX requirement for the same is almost Nil and which has also been done by the Company. The Company had also recently received approvals for expansion of its  Iron Ore benefaction plant from 1MTPA to 3.28 MTPA which will be utilised by it for producing high grade pellets. Why China is preferring high grade pellet?? There are two main reason for this:   High grade pellet in Blast furnace requires lesser amount of Coal for steel production. Lesser amount of burning Coal in Blast Furnace results in less coal energy consumption(and obviously lesser coal consumption) which leads to lesser pollution. reducing pollution has become a thing of paramount importance in China. You can produce steel in China if the process is less polluting so their survival is now dependent on low polluting feed to Blast furnace. This also results in reducing their Energy/Coal expense.   When you are operating at full capacity utilization , high grade pellet increases your output because blast furnace has a fixed capacity and if amount of Coal to be fed is decreased then you can charge/input extra pellet in Blast furnace which will led to higher output for a given capacity i.e with a given capacity your steel out put will be higher if you charge pellet instead of Coal. When you are making high margins in your product you would always prefer to operate at full capacity that to with maximum output.   The above are  two main reasons which are driving   demand for high grade pellet. Further due to lower coal handling and high grade pellet, the duration of cycle of steel production is also reduced in Blast furnace for example if your steel cycle in Blast furnace with  low grade Iron ore is X hrs then because of high grade pellet it will come down by 3 to 4 % because of which the efficiency of Blast furnace will increase by 3 to 4 %.

International Market   Iron ore prices have climbed to US$ 233/t, touching multi-year high, and is now trading at US$ 200/t. Among the 3 major iron ore producers globally only Vale has been projecting higher production in FY22. The demand supply is expected to remain tight for next 1-2years.   Pellet prices have been tracking higher iron ore prices and have remained strong at US$241/t CIF China, down from recent peak of US$268/t. China is focused on decarbonisation of the economy and this has increased demand for higher grade pellets and iron ore.     Domestic market   Indian iron ore prices have almost doubled in last 3 months to 9300/t for 62% Fe (Orissa iron ore fines).   Indian iron ore production declined by 44mnt in FY21 and at the same time cost curve got bumped up as the winning bid premium on recently held auction in Odisha has been between 90%-150% of IBM iron ore prices.   Pellet prices in India have hit 10 year high. Domestic Pellet demand & prices are on rise due to shortage of iron ore. Current pellet prices are trading close to 15,000+ per tonne for 64%/63% Fe.

Thats why these cyclical stocks trade at low PE between 6-10 PE usually. For example Maithan alloys, IMFA, Sarda energy, Shyam, Rain industries, HEG, Graphite, Coal India, MOIL, and many others. If you see MOIL, it makes a paltry annual EBITDA between 300 crore in the worst year, and 600 crore in the best year. Compared to this GPIL makes 600 crore in the worst year, and 2000 crore in the best year. Infact with the capacity expansion, the worst possible EBITDA for GPIL would be near 1200 crore now (including the new billet capacity). Even here, just 6x EV/EBITDA multiples would give 7200 cr mkt cap. MOIL is at 4000 crore market cap and is a PSU with poor capital allocation decisions and a bad promoter- the govt.

Many small steel mills in India buy iron ore lumps or pellets from open market and convert it into sponge iron or billets and sell them again. They get a conversion margin. The price of sponge iron and Billets are near all time highs in India, just 5-7% off from all time highs. This has given downward price protection to pellets and iron ore price in India. We need to track billets, sponge iron, wire rod and pellet prices as GPIL makes and sells all of these. The price of billets, wire rods etc are dependent on STEEL prices.

Some of the points I noted during the AGM are given below: 	NCLT approval for the merger is expected to be received by October, 2019. Board will take a call on dividend post the merger. 	We are working to reduce inventory days in Swiss Glascoat. 	Order book  Both HLE and Swiss Glascoat have inventory of more than 6  7 months. 	Post-acquisition of Swiss Glascoat by HLE Engineers, we have added quite a few new customers. 	HLE is a market leader in Agitated Nutsche Filter Dryer (ANFD) with 50% plus market share. Like Glass Line Equipment (GLE), ANFD also have oligopoly market structure with top 3 players controlling 80% of the market. Our largest competitor in ANFD is GMM. We have been in these segment for decades and have built expertise in it over the years. 	HLE started as a chemical company and later forayed into ANFD. Post restructuring in the group, a portion of chemical business remained in HLE as the ANFD division shared the same premise as that portion of chemical division. We might plan to shut these chemical division going forward. Chemical division contributes Rs.40  50 crore to sales of HLE. 	HLE uses stainless steel while Swiss Glascoat used Carbon Steel. Post-merger, there will be synergies in procurement and increased bargaining power with steel manufacturers. 	We completed expansion in Swiss Glascoat by almost 40% in February, 2019. The benefit of that will accrue in the current year. Furthermore, we might look for further expansion by year end. Total cost of capex was Rs.15 crore funded through debt and internal accruals. 	HLE had low margins in FY17 as it was one off year where we had to shut down capacities for undergoing modernization and capacity expansion. 	Market size for GLE business is Rs.500 crore while for ANFD business is Rs.500 crore. Both the segments are seeing increase in demand due to large capex being undertaken by chemical and pharmaceutical industry (largely API). 	GMMs EBITDA margins are higher than Swiss Glascoat on account of some pricing advantage which they have due to their MNC parentage, conversion to gas based furnace and export sales which have much higher margins than domestic markets. There are lot of low hanging fruits in Swiss Glascoat to improve margins. For the expansion, we have used gas based furnace instead of electric furnace installed in existing plant. Furthermore, Swiss Glascoat currently derives negligible revenue from exports. We have started focussing on exports by participating in chemical fairs. We want to focus on export markets as well now. HLE already derives 5  10% of revenue from overseas markets. 	Post takeover by new management, in Swiss Glascoat we have done three major changes: o	Capex for expansion in capacities which got completed in February, 2019 o	Substantial debottlenecking done in the plant o	Changed lay out of the plant for better operations 	Lot of synergies in marketing in HLE and Swiss Glascoat. There are hardly any orders where we are not discussing ANFD and GLE products in the same breadth. HLE does its marketing through its own offices while Swiss Glascoat works through its own channel partners. 	HLE is also seeing major shift happening from centrifugal filter and dryer market as ANFD is the latest and advanced technology. However, ANFD prices are more than centrifugal ones. Large chemical players already use ANFD while smaller companies in the sector use centrifugal filters and dryers. 	Replacement cycle for HLE is 10 years plus while for GLE it varies from 3 to 10 years depending on usage. On an average the lifecycle of GLE is 8  9 years. However, in more corrosive environment the lifecycle of GLE is less. 	Growth in Swiss Glascoat will be more than HLE as there is lot of room for improvement in market share in it. 	Exports are a thrust area for us in Swiss Glascoat. We have participated in trade shows in Germany and received some export orders as well. Export sales will grow sharply as we currently hardly have any sales from it. Europe, South East Asia and US will be our major markets for exports. 	In terms of quality in GLE, we are at par with our competitors. If companies like Divis, Bayer and other large chemical/pharmaceutical API companies are our customers speaks a lot about our quality. Name any large player in the segment and we would have supplied products to them. 	Advances from customers range from 10  30% depending on client and quantum of order to be supplied  for both HLE and Swiss Glascoat. 	With current capacity, Swiss Glascoat can do turnover of Rs.180  200 crore while HLEs equipment division can do revenue of Rs.250  300 crore. 	HLE holds 80% stake in HL Equipment which has a plant in Silvassa. It also manufactures ANFD. 	ANFDs are highly customized and complex products.  Requirement of each and every customer is different. We have also launched off the shelf model in FY19 targeting smaller chemical companies where there is no customization and price is lower. The machine received good success. 	Operating leverage can come in both the companies  HLE and Swiss Glasscoat with increase in revenue. 	Inventory is on higher side in Swiss Glascoat compared to GMM? Taking measures to improve inventory days. Increased vendor base to two from earlier one. We require specialized carbon steel. Inventory day rationalisation will take time but will eventually happen. 	We supply reactors as well as tanks. We are also present in high KL reactors and provide the entire range to customers. 	Target growth of 15  20% in revenue over the next 2  3 years in both the companies combined.

In fact, just to share another data with you HLEs GLE sales have increased by 43% while GMMs sales have increased by 30% in 9MFY20 (sharing nine months data since full year financials for HLE are not out yet). Currently, the industry has its hands full and almost all the players in the industry have order book of 3 - 6 months including the unlisted players like Sachin Industries and Standard Glass Lining. No doubt, GMM being a MNC has better reputation in the industry and even pricing is a bit higher compared to other companies. However, HLE also gets business from reputed companies like Divis, Bayer, Bharat group etc which reflects that its quality is also not that bad (I doubt if these companies will come to HLE just on the basis of lower pricing). Not sure if GMM will eat into the market share of HLE. One interesting development which is happening in the pharma API industry is the kind of incentives Central Government is providing to API and intermediate companies to set up manufacturing facilities in India. Some recent announcements include providing incentives as well as providing grants to support common infrastructure for bulk drug parks. Two notifications attached for reference Production Linked Incentive Scheme for promotion of domestic ma (1).pdf (2.3 MB) Scheme for Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks_0.pdf (1.2 MB) Many large formulation companies have announced their plans to be more backward integrated by setting up API and intermediate manufacturing plants. Pharma City in Hyderabad has also picked up pace with state government also pretty serious about it. Pharma demand for GLE and allied products which had remained muted for past 2 - 3 years is also expected to pick up going forward as also mentioned in GMMs conference call for FY20 results. Also, one important point to note here is that along with increase in GLE demand, HLEs other product - filtration and drying product (where it is the market leader in India with more than 50% market share) should also see increased demand with API manufacturing coming up. Yashashvi Rasayan is a group company of HLE and there are no major inter company transactions between them. They are not even cross holdings between the two group companies.

One issue is  the cash conversion cycle of almost 170 days but that should get corrected hopefully.   Cash conversion cycle 170 days ? Could you please provide some link to justify it. Because in the AR 2014-15 I didnt find any mention on it. Most of the Pharma companies out there in the market are quoting a P/E of > 30. My understanding is that the main reason for it to trade at lesser P/E is the promoters holding which is around 36%. But if you breakdown the SHP from AR, 33% of shares are held by someone who is close to the promoters i.e. relatives/friends. So, there wont be any issues with respect to the decision making. In my view, accounting the above point this stock should be valued at 30 P/E at least. Also, if we look at the last 10 years 17% sales growth & 22% profit growth is decent enough. Year 2015-16 seems to be a inflection point where the company is clocking 90Cr sales. If we be conservative of 6Cr profit, EPS would be around 15. Another good part is that the company is spending money is expanding its sales network which is why employee cost increased, I presume. They are mainly targeting the countries in South America, Africa and Asia. Their injectible plant is ready and they are in the process of applying for USFDA.

Is it to siphon off certain jobs and revenues to subsidiaries - potentially to create 100% owned dividend paying subsidiaries? Also the PAT margin on the subsidiary is < 1% - seems like either non-value add work is being farmed to the subsidiary or LP is not doing arms length transactions with the subsidiary. Seemed a little surprising. The company does not need give any explanation of the raison-de-etre of this subsidiary.

Since there has been no post on this for the last 9 months, I would like to start with some notes from the latest annual report shared with me by @yogansh. Annual Report FY19 notes:  Appointed Darshit A. Shah as CFO of the Company w.e.f. March 28, 2019. Promoter holding: 32.39% (PY 32.14%)  However, when one looks at the top 10 public shareholders it looks like there are some family members (Patels) who are classified as non-promoters who hold more than 10% in LPL. Therefore, it seems that the cumulative shareholding is close to 43%.    On product basket-  Companys main focus is on Cardiac and Diabetic Segments as we have till now achieved a good growth in these segments. Respiratory segment we have expanded our basket with new set of products, so  we are expecting extensive growth in this.   Revenue break-up:  India: 155.6 Cr (PY 201.1 Cr) Export: 197.4 Cr (PY 124.4 Cr) 1 customer contributes more than 10% of the revenue.   Subsidiaries:  Lincoln Parenteral: Sale 50.86 Cr | PAT 2 Cr (47 Cr sale is to Lincoln Pharma) Zullinc Healthcare: Sale 3.48 Cr | PAT 10 Lac Savebux: Sale 12 Lac | PAT 2.64 Lac    R&D expense 4.20% (PY 3.58%) of turnover.  Capitalized: 4.53 Cr (PY 3.58 Cr) Expense: 10.27 Cr (PY 8.08 Cr)   Non-Current Loans given:  Loans given to others 13.3 Cr (PY 6.28 Cr) Security Deposits given to Lincoln Parenteral (Subsidiary) 15.57 Cr (PY 14.66 Cr) Inter-Corporate Loans 2.5 Cr (PY 1.62 Cr) Loans and advance to others: 1.75 Cr (PY 4 Cr)    What I like about this company-  Even though revenues look muted for the last 3-4 years, the company has reduced its trading activities and has forayed aggressively in branded exports segment. LPL had around 120cr of export revenues in FY17 and has done 116cr of export revenues already in H1FY20. This highlights their focus on their exports business. Purchase of stock-in-trade has reduced from 210cr in FY16 to 52cr in FY19. Margins seems to be higher in the export business and hence PAT has increased significantly from 12cr (on a revenue of 210cr) in FY14 to 49cr (on a revenue of 366cr in FY19).  The company has reduced its long term borrowings from 25cr in FY15 to 0.5cr as on Sept19.  LPL has spent 54cr on R&D since FY14 out of which 15cr was spent in FY19 alone. LPL claims to have 4 patents and over 1700 product registrations with 700 more in pipeline. The company is planning to set up an API unit which is a positive but has not provided with updates on this. For the last 3 quarters their business presentations carry the same update on it- Applied to Pollution Control Board for permission of APIs Unit.  Key Negatives-  Debtor days have deteriorated after export revenues picked up. The company has given loans and advances and hasnt given details on them. For example, loans to others at the end of FY19 was 13.3cr and another 1.75cr for which no details have been provided. Similarly, LPL has given interest free security deposits to its subsidiary, Lincoln Parental, of 15.57cr. And some inter-corporate loans of 2.5cr.  Advance to suppliers under Related Party to Sunmed Corporation of 1cr   Even though managerial remuneration looks low at 1.27cr, there are a couple of entries in the Related Party Transactions where the promoter family is taking away 94L in commission. Intense competition in the domestic generic formulations industry, which limits the companys revenue growth in the domestic market and constraints its pricing flexibility  If the company can reduce these related party transactions and improve their communication with the investors (business presentations have been similar for a lot of quarters now) then there can be real value unlocking done. The company is long-term debt free and export sales are increasing which have better margins. This coupled with their investments into R&D and a lot of products in the pipeline waiting for registrations augurs well for the company.

Have read last few years of annual reports, this thread and also saw some videos from the company on YouTube. Has anyone been able to figure out reason for the high trade receivables ? I was looking at some metrics like trade_receivables/sales in a year. The midcap pharma companies I have invested in, the number is around 10%-25%. For great mid-cap/large-cap companies(Dr reddys, Cipla, Aurobindo) as well this number is close to 20-25%. However, for Lincoln Pharma, this number is around 42%. This is what worries me. The company has a market cap of 300 odd crore and trade receivables of 148 cr. How does this make sense? I also dug through the 2019 Annual report (https://www.lincolnpharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annual-Report-2018-19-1.pdf) and found some things :  If you CTRL+F for trade receivable You come on to the page 58 of the annual report (page 60 of PDF) where it says that trace receivables are explained in Note 14. I go to note 14 which is page 78 of annual report (page 80 of PDF). The thing which confuses me here is why trade receivables considered good keep growing every year. If they are considered good, when would they be paid to the company? This row keeps growing every year! Another thing to note is the following line on this page: Details of receivables from firms / private companies in which directors of the company are partners / directors (Please refer note no. 53) Note that note 53 is printed as note 52 (which occurs twice) in this annual report. Thankfully the related party trade receivables are on lower side compared to total trade receivables.  @aga.ayush11  @yogansh @ayushmit  any idea why the trade receivables are growing every year but management is still showing them as good and not taking provisions?

My interpretations based on Q1 results and management interview to CNBC TV-18:  The percent of exports in revenue is growing. From 11% of total sales in FY13, it grew to 56% of total sales in FY20 to about 78% in Q1-FY21. Cost of materials consumed has gone from 21 cr to 27 cr YoY which is a jump of about 29%. Since sales have only gone up 7%, does this depict a reduction in pricing power for the company? Changes In Inventories of Finished Goods, Stock-In trade and WIP has gone up from 1cr to 7cr. Not sure how to interpret this, but this potentially represents products for domestic sales which could not be sold due to suppressed demand due to covid-19. Total Revenue up 7%, Net profit and EPS up 23% YoY. Profits outpaced revenue growth mostly due to reduction in costs. For example, employee costs went down from 15cr to 13cr. Company has received EU GMP certification from Germany FDA and plans to start selling in EU sometime in this financial year. CNBC TV-18 anchors were upset with the management for guiding for 15-20% growth in Q1 and only achieving 7% growth. Mr patel tried to clarify that their anticipation of covid-impact was not accurate until now. Has guided for 25-50% revenue growth for rest of FY. My 2 cents are, small businesses face highest amount of uncertainty. Sometimes management  might feel pressured to provide guidance. I would not take such guidance seriously. Vitamin C+Zinc tablets referenced above only expected contribute 10cr to topline. Total opportunity size in India is 150 cr.

The PAT has increased to 50 cr on a standalone basis as against PAT of 47 cr in previous year representing growth rate of 6.3% New product development The Company manages the risk through careful market research for selection of new products, planning and continues monitoring. The companys Research and Development (R&D) Department has developed many new Formulations. The Company has developed 600 plus formulations in 15 therapeutic areas and has a strong product/brand portfolio in anti-infective, respiratory system, gynaecology, cardio & CNS, anti-bacterial, ant-diabetic, anti-malaria among others.

Only 15% is considered to be high credit risk receivable in FY20 as against 21% in FY19. Profit and Loss Statement As the debt has gone down, credit costs (as a part of Expenses) has also come down (4cr => 2cr). Cost of materials consumed has gone up sharply by 25% (81cr => 101 cr). Given that total expenses have also gone up by ~ 24cr, this means the majority of expenses going up has been the cost of materials consumed. Revenue from operations has also gone up by ~23cr, which means that broadly speaking, the company was able to pass on the increase in cost of materials in terms of the pricing of their products.

This shows that it is shareholder friendly. 1600641 When the earnings rose due to Covid-19, Management clearly outlined that the revenue was growing disproportionately due to Covid-19. In fact they outlined exactly how much the jump in revenue was due to Covid related sales. 1600582 Investment thesis The company revenues and profits were compounding well even before Covid-19 hit. Company creates products which are consumed in industries with good tailwinds: agro, diagnostics, animal nutrition, human nutraceuticals etc. It remains to be seen whether any of the elevated sales due to Covid-19 are sticky or purely one-off. If the company is able go create new relationships with clients leading to sustainably higher business, then the investment thesis becomes much better. Valuation Looking at the last 10 years it has been valued at close to 0.8x revenues. This is common in small and illiquid companies like Titan. Investors pay a discount due to the high probability of failure. It is available at 1.1x sales right now, which is a bit above average valuation. 1600471 One has to take their individual call regarding valuation but I would be comfortable buying little quantities at these levels and either average up (if the business improves) or average down (if business improves but price collapses due to any factors). Risks   Peanut-Buttering: For a company of this size, they seem to be spreading themselves too thin. What surprised me was the absolute number of products they manufacture. As per my estimation, from all the 3 websites, this number is around 50. While some products would share processes, this is still a fairly large number of products. One risk to the investment thesis is that possibly they do not manufacture all these products, some of them could potentially just be traded. Trading companies are not as exciting as manufacturing companies.  Scale-up: This is a small company (70 cr turnover). There is always the risk that they would not be able to scale up. Here are some articles that demonstrate in an unrelated industry (auto), how hard it has been for Tesla (US listed auto-maker) to scale up (link1, link2).  Valuations: One key monitorable would be about the nature of covid-19 vaccine. If it turns out that Covid-19 would need regular vaccines (say twice a year for life), then the companys revenues from TMMedia (Viral Transmission Kits) are potentially scalable since people would need to get tested regularly for Covid-19. In this scenario, the revenues would probably remain at elevated levels, in years to come. On the other hand, if it turns out 1 covid vaccine lasts a person immunity for lifetime, then these elevated revenues (7cr additional sales in Q2FY21) would go away. In such a scenario, the current TTM earnings are superficially elevated and hence, the company is available at a steep valuation compared to its usual earnings.  Investor-Friendliness: In a small company like this one, it is also difficult to know what is going on inside the company. As the reader can see in the second post, investors had asked some very good questions about the companys functioning, but all of them were not satisfactorily addressed by the management. This remains a risk of investing in such a small company. Unlike mid and large sized companies, we cannot expect communication with management more than twice (Annual Report & AGM) a year.  Pricing Power: While the company claims to be a Biotech company, most of their products are commodity in nature (as per my understanding) and hence it is not possible for Titan Biotech to have any pricing power: their profitability is completely a function of demand-supply dynamics which are difficult to forecast for outside investors.  PS: I could find an older topic for Titan Biotech, but it was perhaps closed due to an incomplete first post. Hence, i started a new topic. Would be happy if we want to merge the two.

Nature of company: Chemicals we make: Break-up of revenues and how do we see the various segments growing. What would you classify as an intermediate versus a finished product, that we are selling? What are our key starting materials, and how much of manufacturing processes are fermentation based? How much of the business is Purely fermentation based versus chemical Synthesis. How many steps do we have in the products that we are making? Who is your competition? Especially with respect to imports. I have not found many domestic companies which make these products? How much of products are supplied to Pharma, Diagnostic labs, other companies? Are these continuous batch processes, Culture medium what is the process of making it? Is it made continuously or is it made in batches? How do the facilities look? What is the nature of assets? Youve written a lot about peptones in your annual report.

Is it due to the product mix becoming better or is it because sales price has moved higher? Raw material prices and stability. 2017 AR you said you modernized the plant. What did you do exactly?

I would like to understand if TM media is part of stand-alone entity? What was contribution to revenues in FY20 and Q1-FY21? If I understand, we were making Viral transmission media in TM media. How is this space evolving? We must be seeing intense competition and price erosion. What was price Realization earlier and what are we doing now?

What are our plans for Capex going forward? We have a subsidiary peptech biosciences. Can you please tell some information about what they do? Borrowing limit was raised. We are doing well, so why was it raised? We have sought approval for inter-corporate deposits, which are concerning since there is a risk they are not at fair value.

NK Singla (MD, Titan Biotech):  Started as a culture media manufacturing company in 1992. First company in India to manufacture Media bases and Formulated Culture Media from scratch. Continuously added products. Today we are dealing in biological products which find applications in microbiology, Nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, Animal nutrition as well. Protein based ingredients form the bulk of our starting material. The process varies from Product to Product and processes are continuously improved. Our products are mostly intermediates. They do not qualify for one to step down. They are used as ingredients in Formulations. Processing aid in fermentation. Or Base for culture media. We do hydrolysis of our products. We do import certain ingredients like propionic acid. But products are not imported from any country with which India has any problems. We are importing agar agar as a raw material for culture media. Import value stands at 12.82 crores. We have competition from Various Industries (My guess, was not very audible). Dealing in ingredient manufacturing, diagnostic media, and lab chemicals. Due to wide range of products, we have various raw materials like agar agar, soya, casein, Margins are always market driven and variable and cannot be commented upon. Manufacturing processes differ product to product. Some have large batch sizes, some have small batch sizes. The time required for manufacturing also varies a lot by the type of type of product from a few hours to up to 72 hours. Peptech Biosciences is our subsidiary company and deals in Agro products. The balance sheet is uploaded on the company website. Sales and profitability has increased in recent years. There is lot of variety in our products from peptones, culture media and chemicals and ASP varies a lot depending on product to product and qualities sold. Prices are driven by market. As market trends change, we add new products and discontinue products where demand is not strong. The first plant of the company, built in 1994 has been completely refurbished in 2018. Constant upgradations are made to introduce new tech and keep up with best practices in industry. Increased demand in Q1 is pandemic related and should not be seen as permanent in nature. Culture Media And diagnostic division has contributed most in Q1FY21. Gross margins have increased due to increased demand for culture media for transfer of viral medium due to pandemic. The excess cash flow will be utilized by the company in working capital and also in doing capex. Were analyzing the market forces and decisions will be taken on capacity expansions soon. Were looking into forward integrations wherein we would supply formulative nutraceutical products as well. Regarding amino acids, we manufacture amino acid mixtures, chillads along with a mixture of zinc, magnesium, manganese, selenium, copper, iron etc. These find applications in plant and animal nutritions. Key growth drivers: addition of new products, constant cost monitoring has helped achieve good margins and growth. Culture media, nutraceuticals, food ingredients majorly to sales. In total we have export sales of 13.65cr and domestic sales of 55.83cr in FY20. We have distributors and direct customers in many countries. TM Media is brand name under which we are promoting our diagnostics related products and chemicals. Viral transport kits have found great acceptance due to Covid pandemic. We are encountering wide competition in this space as well. With new players entering the market it is hard to understand sustainable prices and orders. Demand and supply constantly changing. There are 2,000 culture media products company is manufacturing. The capex helped introduce new machines, which enabled us to acquire new clients, who audited our plants and were happy with it.

Description Here is a good link on tm media (titan biotech brand): https://www.tmmedia.in/sites/default/files/TMVT%20001_Viral%20transport%20kit_1.pdf The intended use is for collection and transport of clinical specimen for recovery of viral agents. A Viral Transport kit is intended for the collection and transport of clinical specimens containing viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas from the collection site to the testing laboratory. It is ready to use transport swab kit, designed to maintain viral viability and transport viruses in active form for isolation. The peculiar design of the flocked swab ensures optimal elution of the specimen into the transport medium. The kit comprises of one sterile flocked specimen collection swab and a tube of Viral Transport Medium. The viral transport medium contains essential buffers and antibiotics required for maintaining the viability of the viruses during transport. The medium is also recommended by CDC and WHO for collection and transport of Covid-19 virus. Here is an ICMR guideline which validates the fact that they have indeed tested and recommend using TMMedia VTK as a standard solution for Covid-19 Sample collection:           icmr.gov.in            Advisory_for_Reagents_TestingLabs_v1.pdf  549.73 KB                          (see Serial number 7 at https://www.icmr.gov.in/ctestlab.html). Note that this was issued 1/4/2020 and so for sure new VTKs would have been approved post that date. VTK Price Movement Ideally we would like to track the price movement of the VTK. However, this is not easily available. So, we instead track the price movement of the RT-PCR test, which has the kit as a component. Since both prices are driven by demand and supply, there should be proportional moves in prices of both. All the data is taken from Kilpests bse filings. Example: https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/8c58e558-4afe-4d9f-8d97-6da6c62aa850.pdf     Month Price Volume     June 500 666000   August 325 422000   September 230 868000   October 172 909000    As we can, sww, the price has eroded 66% since June although volumes have gone up 50%. One can expect roughly similar price erosion and volume expansion (potentially) for Titan Biotech as well. Impact on Revenues This FY From the Q2-FY21 filing, out of 27cr revenue in Q2, 7.5cr was due to covid-19.  For the Q1-FY21 filing, out of 39cr revenue in Q1-FY21, break up due to covid-related revenues is not given. The Q1-FY20 Revenue was 22cr. This is an almost 90% rise in revenues. Company mentions in filing that a lot of revenue increase is due to covid specific demand (for VTKs). Valuation Estimation Disclaimer: What follows is my estimate for sustainable NP increases in FY21. As with all estimates, this estimate is incorrect. I hope it proves to be useful though. Q2-FY20 revenue was 16cr. So, the sustainable revenue growth in this Quarter was 25%.  36% of revenue increase was sustainable. Net Profit increased from 1.34cr 6.78cr in Q2. Due to operating leverage let us assume that only 10% of NP increase was sustainable. This works out to 0.54cr. This implies NP increase of 0.54cr (40%). Note that this number is very close to the 5-year CAGR of the NP as outlined in first post on the topic. If we assume a similar NP increment over entire FY, then sustainable NP for FY21 would be ~10cr. With a median P/E of 12, the P/E based median valuation is 120cr for End of FY21. Current marketcap is 110cr, so there is very little margin of safety. As the Q3 and Q4 results show a lower QoQ growth, I would expect stock price to be under pressure, and hence for the margin of safety for the purchase price to go up. This might present an informed investor with a good buying opportunity.

More importantly promoters have bought ~37K shares in 4 tranches. Is there some part of story which is missing here? Also median PE is 12 for titan biotech. What about PE of similar companies? I could not find another companies with similar market cap in this space. But PE of 12 looks highly under pitched. They also have nil debt if we consider 8 Cr cash vs 8 Cr debt on their books.

I think you have not understood the financial model in an IT products space. They have made a loss, but did you see their quarterly results. They have spent close to 100 crores this quarter on R and D and sales and distribution. In the products space as the products mature R and D and sales and distribution drop drastically. You can check the financials of Accelya kale (products in aviation space) and may be also Ramco systems. You will find that in accelya kale r and d and sales and practically zero. The growth of 20 percent is actually conservative. If you install a core banking system or a risk management system with a client it is like a toll bridge for the next 15 years. The real money is in the enhancements and maintenance that follows year after year. That is exactly what jain had mentioned when he gave the 20 percent projection. He was banking on what i mentioned above. Yes there are companies with proper cash flows available in this segment e.g. nucleus or accelya. But look at their valuations. Intellect today is in the stage where they were 5 years back and look at the multiples investors have earned. I know polaris financial suite and it is pretty good. With the investments they are making expect more deal acquisitions going forward and re rating that will surely happen. Operating leverage is the key here. All new sales directly flow to the bottom line in a product business. With gross margins at 50 percent and slated to increase to 60 percent in products space there is massive operating leverage gains. Net margins shoot up. Track the margins for accelya kale to validate what i am saying. At the end of the day you are betting that their products are installed with more and more locations so that this effect comes into place. I hope the above will help you in analyzing this stock from a different perspective. Rs. 45 I am not sure you will get that price :):), with their cash per share near Rs. 30.

Arun Jain was well ahead of the curve. http://www.thesmartceo.in/magazine/cover-story/transformation-by-design.html Thinking of design For this feature, Jain explained to us what he means by the concept of design thinking. aItas a four-step process,a he says. aFirst, one has to feel the emotional side of how a customer, investor and employee will react. Second, one has to observe the common patterns in the entire industry. Third, to connect the dots among all these different happenings and finally, unearth the blind spots,a says Jain, adding a theoretical layer to his explanation. This methodical approach meant that the demerger process went on smoothly from all standpoints. For example, Jain and his senior team conducted informal sessions with various subject matter experts and external consultants on what the regulatory expectations were from a documentation standpoint. Jain says, aWe uncovered a fund of information from such sessions and acted upon the findings. Our thorough work in this regard meant that there were no delays in response from regulatory bodies or the court.a To be sure, the concept of design thinking is something the company wants to use in both its services and products businesses across processes; right from the macro level, where business, technology, people and operations come together to the level of adding features to a particular product. The macro vision Polaris 4.0 also earmarks a new phase in the entrepreneurial journey of Jain. A 25-year veteran in this industry, Jainas day-to-day role now includes that of a coach for his five CEOs. He says, aI am glad to say that weave now attracted the best of talent from the industry. My personal role will be to help our CEOs uncover any blind spots they encounter, be it in strategy, systems, style or organisational structure.a Additionally, Jain also runs workshops with his team members a project managers and above. Branded Unmukt, these workshops focus on upping the aspirational quotient of his people. aIn addition to skill development, one of the key aspects of building organisations is to improve the mindset of people,a he adds. Jainas theory is that the whole organisation needs to be aligned to specific purposes. If one of the companyas goals is to reduce complexity in the customer environment, this whole thought has to be internalized, by the entire organisation. With the de-merger almost complete, Jain and his team are now gearing up for the next phase of growth. When Jain used the words asoul of a startupa in his note to shareholders, he was referring to the renewed agility of each line of business, a spirit of entrepreneurship where each CEO is completely empowered to grow his piece of the business and to unearth the potential of a powerful enterprise in its own right.  THE ROLE OF DESIGN THINKING IN DECISION-MAKING IS A FOUR-STEP PROCESS. Jain wants to use the concept of design thinking across the board, right from macro level decision-making to the level of adding features to a particular product. Feel the emotional side of any decision Observe the common patterns (across the industry) Connect the dots among all these different observations Unearth the blind spots  Polaris 1.0 Till 2001: Touched Rs. 296 crore in revenue with a deep focus on financial technology sourcing for the BFSI industry__ Polaris 2.0 2002-2008: Touched Rs. 1,099 crores in revenue, focus on IP building, acquired OrbiTech from Citibank.__ Polaris 3.0 2009-2011: Touched Rs. 1,595 crores; complexity reduction for clients, worked with leading global firms in banking, financial services and insurance Polaris 4.0 2012 onwards: Touched Rs. 2,424 crores in FY 2014.

The demerger has resulted in focus, which was missing when they were the products division of polaris. The problem of having services and product under the same roof is the differential economics of both businesses. Product division is looked upon as EPS diluting in the short run because of the investments in R and D and sales.  This results in pressure from shareholders. Generally in the quarterly results obsessed markets this is a big dampener.  E.g. KPIT is struggling with the same issues with its huge investments in their automobile product development being looked negatively by the market.  So generally you tend to fall between two stools. With a focused approach expectations are set with clear disclosures.  I request the boarders to go through the investors presentation  on the IDA website.  They are extremely transparent and have given clear commentary on any diversions from their projections (E.g. sales have increased just 12 percent this quarter because two deals finalization got postponed).  One of the deals was realized a fortnight back (HDFC bank Sri Lanka). I have tried to use a discounting model to find its valuation assuming that they walk on their projected path. Cash EPS :  -13.52	1.41	68.51	144.25	238.69 Discounting them at 15 percent gives me a valuation of Rs. 192 presently.  Though boarders might call it looking too much forward it gives a benchmark for evaluation of projections against actual results. BTW Jain has projected a 22 to 26 percent growth rate in the next two years and gross margins of 55 percentage.  Now there are two aspects to it.  The license fee revenue will be lumpy with deal wins. More importantly with every installation of say a Core banking system it gives a great view of future enhancement and maintenance revenue streams as an installation of a CBS is usually for a period of 15 years.  So unlike a service company there is a high degree of confidence in future revenue streams, so it is just like a toll bridge.

Pls dont take it otherwise. To stretch it further, Peter Lynch has given several examples of Doctors buying into Chemical companies or Chemical Engineers buying into Pharma stocks  .

Hence by FY18, should be around 10-12% of revenues No major capex planned SG&A at a certain revenue threshold (threshold not mentioned) should be 25% of revenues. Side note: this could be a moving threshold as Arun Jain also said on CNBC today that its possible that IDA would re-invest excess margin for a few years to gain market share which will ultimately result in long-term annuity business. That seems reasonable for a product company and some analyst notes also reflect this as a prudent strategy  So long-term normalized PBT margins could be 20%, not necessarily achievable in FY18. But with a possibility that some of this margin is consciously re-invested for higher revenue growth, the financial trajectory of profits itself is difficult to gauge.

(Omni channel as an example has been there for ages, however its only recently that companies have started bucketing it under Digital). Is this a differentiator for Intellect?   Product Replacement strategy - From a customers standpoint how do they go about integrating Intellect into their existing IT real estate without rocking the ship (given that Financial services industry has been a pioneer in IT spend and yet paradoxically has continued to use legacy systems (mainframes,AS400 etc). This is because the potential pitfalls of replacing age old stable systems is very high. Hence what may happen is that Intellect will end up doing more business with new age banks or banks in emerging countries with no past IT baggage.   Stickiness of Business - I would be interested to know what wrap around services (enhancements and upgrades) can Intellect offer to customers to have an assured annuity business in place.

On the Core banking side, there are few bigger competitors with large number of installations like Temenos,Financle, Banc,Oracle Flexcube etc, and progress has to be monitored here RTM and insurance verticals are yet to show good ramp up in sales -Being a technology company they have to keep wary of emerging threats and product advancements, especially in corporate payments space like Earthport, Ripple etc Product superiority: While management sounds superbullish on this, this point is hard to collate for an outsider like myself.

They are diversified across all regions like US,EU, EMEA,APAC,Africa.They do have products in Banking(Global transaction banking,Consumer banking and Risk/Treasury) and Insurance to distribute their revenues.Their customer base is evenly spread across developed markets and developing markets with 49% revenues coming from US/EU and rest from other markets.Management did accept the fact other markets are not as good as the developed markets when it comes to pricing power.Having said that,they follow a pricing model that is acceptable in various markets. When a companys product gets accepted in developed markets,it is a proof that product does have industrial strength considering the fact banks MONEY is really flowing through your software and no banks would risk their business by choosing an inferior product. 2.Customer Tail: To measure the number of clients and how much they were able to penetrate into their market,we still need to give them sometime to reach a critical mass in their sales.With a $120 million revenue,breadth of clients will not be much to count on.Even management has clarified that the biggest problem in this business is scaling upfaster due to long sales cycle.The time taken by the clients to choose the product and sign an agreement takes 15 to 20 months which shows how difficult for the company to project the future sales growth.Due diligence process by the clients on this business is very long. 3.Digital and Design - the buzzwords: As per the management,their product is the only one built on latest digital technology that is available currently on the market.All their competitors products are 15 to 20 years old.Selling point is their product is X times better than the compeition because of the vision they had when they built this product with digital capabilites.Arun Jain mentioned 10 years of hard work is slowly paying off now.He got this idea of digital when the iPad was launched in 2010.He also added that other can also create a similar product but they have to go through another 5 years atleast to create a similar to theirs.By the time,it is the question of can his CEOs position the product well ahead of the competition in the market. 4.Product replacement strategy: Like Rishi mentoned Intellect is a component based architecture.They can upgrade individual components/modules or the whole suite.Another important point to note here is there are two types of business oppurtunites in this digital space: a.Digital programs: Here,banks try to utilize digital technology by implementing themselves and later they choose a vendor in this process after pow-wow.Here,banks target a business group like marketing,operations etc or group of people like customers,employess,management etc. for this digital programs. Most of Intellect wins are in this space. b.Digital Transformation:Here Banks dont fully understand their business and seek help from companies like Intellect to leap-frog into their business.This invloves untilizing the latest i.digitl technologies like artificial intelligence,analytics,business process management etc, ii.utilizing latest best practises in process and integrate all the business process to enhance the delivery mechanism.This is where intellect is lagging. These are again based on my readings/listening to their concalls.Problem with such B2B business is you have no way to verify what management says.Either you have to be an employee or customer to truly understand their product strength and weakness.

Renowned investor Ramesh Damani in conversation with BloombergQuints Menaka Doshi.                           What about sectors like IT, FMCG, industrials? Have your views on these sectors changed? Well, with the IT sector I have a nuanced view. Its been a long-time favourite of bulls on Dalal Street. We have all cut our teeth with companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS, that have gone up 50 times, 100 times and have made us a lot of money. So we are all very enthralled by those companies and they continue to do well. But those companies pioneered a service-led, business-oriented model in India, which essentially means you export services to the west, bill in rupees, collect in dollars and you make a margin. And because the rupee depreciated and volumes were growing you kept doing well. That model maybe under threat due to automation, competition and just due to the fact that there is a slowdown in global IT spends. But increasingly I find, as an analyst, there are a lot of opportunities in what I call product-oriented companies on Dalal Street. There are a lot of companies catering to vertical markets, building products in knowledge, database, antivirus. They offer some very attractive opportunities to investors, they are available at fairly cheap valuations. So rather than look at the old services-led model, which of course I have in my portfolio, I would also be looking at the product-oriented companies. And there are maybe half a dozen on Dalal Street now that have exciting balance sheets, exciting prospects, and probably deserve a lot of investor attention. So that is my short take on technology. Thats been your position in the recent past as well. And if our research is correct, youd invested in companies such as Polaris, Geometric, Sonata. Are you still adding to such investments? There have been a plethora of offerings in the recent past. Polaris spun off a nice looking product company which I own. There are a lot of others, few companies have come out with an IPO recently. So it requires little bit of digging. The road to riches is never easy. There is risk in these stocks because they are unproven business models yet. We dont know if India can legally sell, in the domestic market, a lot of licenses or are they all going to be pirated software. So time will tell. But I am fairly excited about these companies because they address very good opportunities. For example, the Aadhaar database was built by an Indian company and thats a huge technological achievement. They have 100 crore people on the database. Antivirus software companies are showing up in India. So that makes me excited as a technology investor.

I was almost certain of their rise 6+ months ago  now , Im confused. Reasons -  DSO consistently going on  anyone in tech firm will tel you thats its a critical measure. This quarter DSO is 180! IDA claims 208 total clients  for annualized rev of 850 odd. Per client avg 4 cr. revenue that too with overseas clients ; Operations in 30+ countries  in far flung places in Africa. Does it sound sustainable? 67% of total revenue was implementation in 2QFY17  3Q numbers are not know. This figure has hovered around 70% for a while. Why? As your base grow, the AMC should flow. High DSO and not getting AMC indicates poor project execution. They claim 95% projects on time - if thats the case, why are they not able to collect their fees on time . Personally I feel theyve diversified too much. Take Finacle for example - only core banking and nothing else. While here Intellect even has insurance package. insurance is a very different industry - starting from product development to sales  the whole value chain is different . They have 14 different suites in all! Finally, management is over promising and under delivering for some time now.
