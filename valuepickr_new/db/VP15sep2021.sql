The 2nd one - 55 cr capex to add to existing capacity is ongoing, in parallel. Reactors will keep coming between Q3 and Q4 of this year. As we progress along - Q2, Q3 & so on- we are likely to see improvement in revenue - being contributed from Dahej site.    Gross margin drivers in this qtr  2 factors  Improvement in product mix side. Engaged in longer process value added molecules. RM side  Better RM pricing of Lithium.    Advanced intermediates business  Target is to increase Advanced intermediate business to 40% in couple of years from 30% currently. Targeting 670 cr revenue in FY 24 with full capacities coming to play. Within which targeting 40% share from adv intermediate business. Discussion with new clients are progressing stage wise. Nothing has materialized yet.    Does higher revenue from CFM mean better margins?  Higher revenue from CFM may not necessarily mean better margins. Better margins would be a result of doing more of innovation and from multi stage complex molecules. As they do more of innovation work in CFM space - margin profile should improve.    Working capital  Net Working Capital reduced from Rs. 169 crore in FY20 to Rs. 126.5 crore in FY 21. Working Capital Days improved to 137 days. Will look to maintain the same & improve. Improvement has largely come from inventory side. And to small extent from debtors side.    Debt levels  Current debt - 216 cr. Since some capex is pending - expectation is it will be around 260 to 275 cr by the end of the year. My view: This is something that was discussed in the past and the mgmt had guided that they have a robust demand visibility - and they have looked at different scenarios & kept different opinions in mind while taking the Capex decision.

Asset turnover for the new facility at Dahej is expected at 2.5-3x.  While manufacturing of initial commercial batches has commenced, product quality assurance and customer validation processes are in progress post which full commercial production will begin.  The Dahej plant will enable Neogen to deliver greater value-addition products through multi-stage processes and complex chemistry.  In the first year of operations, management expects EBITDA margin of ~18%. However, margins should inch higher with normalisation of the plant and increased contribution from Advanced Intermediates segment.  With new facility being operationalised, management has reiterated revenue guidance of INR450cr for FY22. Contribution from existing two long-term CSM contracts will be INR60-80cr.  On optimum utilisation at Dahej facility, management expects to achieve overall revenue of INR650-670cr by FY24.  By FY24, management is aiming to achieve product mix of  40% for OC, 40% for Advanced Intermediates (including 20% contribution from CSM) and 20% for IC. Expected increase in contribution from Advanced Intermediates and CSM business over the next 2-3 years should lead to margin improvement.  With increasing revenue, R&D expense should increase to >1% of overall revenue; additional capex would be incurred to fund existing R&D projects.  In Q4FY21, both OC plants achieved utilisation of ~90%.  CSM engagements are progressing well through stages and some of these should materialise in H2FY23 or FY24. Inorganic Chemicals  For the year, improvement in gross margin was on account of product mix change as well as lower raw material prices.  Utilisation level at IC plants stood at 60-70%. Capex  In continuation with initial capex of ~INR75cr for the Dahej facility, second phase of capex to the tune of INR55cr has been currently undertaken. Of this, ~INR25cr has been incurred already and remaining INR35cr will be incurred over FY22.  While planned reactors will be installed over Q3FY22 and Q4FY22, expansion activity will be completed by FY22. This additional capacity will contribute incremental revenue of ~INR150-175cr. Others  Maintenance capex would be in the range of INR20-25cr.  Logistical constraints have eased marginally from what was observed over Mar-Apr21.  Prudent inventory management provided cushion against challenges pertaining to raw material procurement. However, impact of logistical issues was felt on the export front to some extent.  While working capital may rise in FY22 due to operationalisation of Dahej facility leading to higher inventory along with an increase in debtors (based on expected rise in exports), it should normalize to FY21 levels towards the close of FY22.  Additionally, on the supply front, management is eyeing on increasing credit days for its key raw materials.  Going forward, RoE and RoCE should improve slightly in FY22 and by at least 2% post that. Management would like to keep D/E ratio below 1.25x and Debt/EBITDA below 3.5x.  With environmental clearances in place and land availability at Dahej site, new capex will require comparatively less turnaround time.

This volume has grown consistently in the last 5 years otherwise.  image779658 30.4 KB  Even with increased imports, if the import prices were above 65 levels, the margins of domestic players have been good (15-20% range at EBITDA level in FY18 and FY19 for eg.).  image1825587 56.8 KB  Of course imports and dumping is only one aspect of what can get the business good margins (albeit a very important factor). The other factors are o-xylene (the main RM) and PA spreads, demand (paints are a big driver of PA). Yes this is a simple commodity business but its a duopoly. The main competition is outside the country in Korea, China and Indonesia. If that competition is kept out, the domestic players will churn out 25%  EBITDA margins and with the capex done recently numbers can be better than in the past. There may be lot of other nuances but this is the big part of it. Of course valuation matters as well, at current valuation I believe a lot of it is not priced in.

Same has happened in India and now Business has become duopoly which may over a period of time lead to an advantage. Anti-Dumping Duty (The only Truth) - Dumping happens at Thirumalais level as well the products, which are made by the customers. From 2009 till 2021 Thirumalai has done well whenever there is comprehensive ADD (covering all the culprit countries). It was mostly in 2010 and between 2015-2018. The question is how has Thirumalai utilized the money earned during ADD period.  IMG_042221601194 300 KB   IMG_041921601251 365 KB  Raw-Material: RM prices follows either crude or if there is artificial shortage due to production of OX shifting to Para  Xylene. Thirumali has no pricing power and they are not able to pass the RM price increase. Another challenge is that when OX price geos down, customers stop buying because of fear of inventory loss. This has happened at least twice in last 11 years. Operating Skills of the management: Negative Working capital. In 2011 Debtors were 25% of sales. In 2012 they decided to reduce business on credit. In 2021 Debtors has come down to 6% of sales. Inventories will come down significantly, as they scale up in Dahej (80% Customer and 100% RM source is in western part of India). IG Petrochem still has 14-18% of sales with Debtors In spite of various challenges like Higher power costs due to old plant or higher Inventory due to location disadvantage, Thirumalai has shown better ability at managing the operating business. Some of this is getting addressed as they have modernised the TamilNadu plant (which will lead to more than 20 cr of savings in power cost and better efficiency wil lead to higher production/sales) and Dahej will help in reducing logistics cost and inventory. All these will directly flow to flow to Cash Flow and bottomline.     Average of 5 years IG Petro Thirumalai     Debtors (%of sales) 14% 8%   Working Capital (% of sales) 7% 2%   ROIC 36% 62%   Gross Margin 32% 34%    Capital Allocation Skills: Management seems to be prudent. They take time to decide (may be sometimes too slow). WHen they were not able to make money in MA business, they clsoed the plant for 3 years. Sales suffered but prudent was to shut down temprorialy. When Malaysia was not performing, they took charge on the books. Coming back to the question of what has happened with the CASH. They took the profit generated during ADD and modernised the TN plant and undertook Greenfield Dahej plant. This time they are nimble. Upcomming ADD will help with cash and they are expanding in USA and Dahej. Over a period of time profit from ADD will help them gain scale, geographical reach and new capabilities in adjacent businesses. Even partial success may change the dynamics of the business (similar to NOCIL) Optionality: Malaysia and US can change the trajectory Concern:  Large Expansion By IG Petro and Thirumalai. Unless the majority of the capacity is used for the downstream projects it may create supply glut. India Needs comprehensive ADD for many years to be able to absorb this capacity Sources of Fragility: The profitability of the business is totally dependent on the Government. This is being addressed through downstream business. No pricing power and no control on RM Next Generation - The new MD has to show the hunger to grow while being prudent. In the past Thirumalai has been too conservative but it seems thats changing now under Ramya. Single Location Risk: With new plant in Dahej and subsequent expansion, risk arising of single location with be mitigated.  Levers of growth: 1. Market expansion (In the current line + new usage of PA) 2. Volume captured from import 3. Better pricing and margin due to downstream products and scale 4. US and Malaysia business ADD and RM will always create opportunities to enter at lower levels and make money during the better years. Due to Duopoly structure, increasing PA demand, the Trajectory of business may change with scale and downstream products  but this has to be seen.

The product is used in TB multi-drug combination therapy so market is big and growing, till some new science changes the treatment.

CAGR is quite uneven, company had early turnaround from BIFR in FY2016 technically but only acknowledged in FY2018 AR. Now it appears that it is able to deploy a strong growth strategy.

Under the  scheme of re-habilitation a lot of operating and functional changes  were brought in the company. The Face Value of each share of the Company was reduced from Rs.10 to Rs. 5 and the reduction in the value of equity shares was utilized to write-off a part of accumulated losses of the Company . Themis Medicare Ltd. was inducted as co-promoter of the Company and issued 2928702 shares of FV rs 5 at 10rs each. The induction of Themis as a co-promoter brought in the much needed sting and zeal in the operations of the company. The  new promoters  also  brought  in the sole long term customer in  Lupin . Lupins deal with GTBL changed the fortunes of the company. The contours of this deal were very lucrative for GTBL. GTBL entered into a contract with lupin to supply Rifa (with the technology know-how brought in with another co-promoter  Yuhan Corporation).  Lupin gave GTBL interest-free loan for capex  that was required to finish the contract. This loan from Lupin was a returnable non-interest bearing loan and was repayable against 50% of the Conversion Charges for each invoice raised. So, this deal was beneficial to GTBL in more than one ways. Needless, to say this contract brought in very good topline and bottomline for the company. To the credit of  GTBL, with each passing quarter the company has been improving its operating efficiency and it now has  one of the best operating parameters  in the industry. With announcement of the supply agreement with Lupin  that started from 1st April 2015  Mar 2018 the company got solid visibility to its earnings. This had a very positive impact on the fiscal position of the company. Since the company came out of BIFR, the company will expand to newer products.  Additionally, the company is also exploring the possibility of offshoring some of the manufacturing of its another promoter, Yuhan Corporation. Given the already established operational efficiency of the company any increase in revenue would significantly add to the bottomline too and  the company is expected to clock significant revenue and profit growth in the years to come.

Investor friendliness may also be an issue due to promoter domination but that may improve(?) as company scales operations. Currently they do not have even latest reports on the company website.

AR 2018 says:  The Industry continued to face challenges due to imposition of price controls and bringing many products under the ambit of National List of Essential Medicines.

The analysis of the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) clearly shows that stock limits and price controls under the Act lead to sub-optimal outcomes which are actually opposite to what the Act is mandated to achieve, it added.  It seems that drug price control is really a serious, ongoing concern in the pharma sector:  The current drug price control policy has had many unintended consequences. For example, many pharmaceutical companies have opted to go out of production because their profit margins decreased. This has led to substandard and spurious drug manufacturers dominating the pharma market. In the absence of strict quality regulations, there has been a trade-off between price and quality; a report by the United States Trade Representative claims that 20 per cent of drugs in India are fake. Decrease in profit margins of quality manufacturers has led to a reduction in spending in research and development. It has deterred future investments in the pharmaceutical sector. Many manufacturers migrated to non-essential drugs (80 per cent of the drugs in non-essential list) or stopped promoting essential drugs.

Also, to get a clearer understanding about the product. Rifampicin and Rifaximin are themselves APIs. GTBL produces Rifamycin S and Rifamycin O which are used to make Rifampicin and Rifaximin, respectively. So, Rifamycin S and O seem to be API intermediates instead of APIs. I checked their old ARs also to get a product wise revenue detail (you may see FY15), it lists Rifamycin-S as the product generating revenues (not Rifampicin). Please correct me if Im reading this wrong. Now if they were producing the API itself and had to cater to the export market (regulated), theyd require quality compliance certifications (GMP, FDA, etc). But I dont have much clarity on API intermediate regulations. Why this feels important is that it opens up a very interesting field. India is heavily dependent upon KSM and API intermediates on China. More so for fermentation based. If GTBL can cater to the companies like Solara, Granules, etc. who are already selling Rifaximin API (Generic, not Rifamycin O), it could be potentially a very good opportunity. So do you know the regulatory requirement for API intermediates for regulated markets? Can GTBL currently sell to companies targeting export markets? To reiterate the above, here is a leaf out of GTBLs FY20 AR GTBL Optimus18871199 359 KB You can see they have a loan from Optimus Drugs Pvt. Ltd. (the interest bearing amount and the difference between it and the total amount indicate it as sort of a soft loan with procurement interests in mind). The product list of Optimus on their website has both Rifaximin API as well as formulations. They have no presence in Rifampicin. So Optimus is a sure shot client. And the loan amount is also not a small amount considering GTBL just commercialised Rifamycin-O production. So they must have the volumes to supply to Optimus. Another interesting point is that Optimus has a US-DMF for Rifaximin and is listed as a supplier.

Financial crunch might have made the management to overlook some small dues kept unpaid as has been pointed out by some members above.   Many famous business groups like Reliance, Jaiprakash does not have good history. Reliance had opened so many companies operation of which became unsuccessful. Value of shares and money invested in those companies by small investors was eroded to 80-90%. Finally, only Reliance Industries came out successful and the promoters had to somehow merge all those companies in this big RELIANCE and get rid of legal procedures. But what about the loss incurred by the shareholders? People are forgetting past by looking the present and to the future. Similar case happens in all business.   In the present case whatever happened to Ganesh Benzoplast was due to natures fury and extreme bad luckt, where they have lost everything. If any default in financial matters have happened was purely on compulsion and not intentional of the management. Form that minus 100% condition (not having even a single penny net-worth of the earlier two businesses), the company has now came to a stand erect position in another high margin business. The new business of leasing out Liquid Petroleum Product Storage facility is showing good results. Hence, we may perhaps forgive the management, particularly the young generation (the son of the founder), who is showing his capability and skill in improving the business.

The Co. has a somewhat chequered history & its young Chairman Rishi Pilani, who has been navigating the Co. through some pretty rough weather in the past, seems determined to change all that! I found him to be both upright and forthcoming. He was quite open to interacting with the shareholders & addressing their queries. The Co. has two divisions. The logistics division is a high margin business wherein the Co. has storage facilities on various Indian ports to handle liquid cargo like Petro products, chemicals, edible oils etc. Its current capacity is about 3,00,000 KL in Nhava Sheva, Cochin & Goa. The Nhava Shiva facility in Navi Mumbai (JNPT) which holds about 90% capacity is where all the action is. The port traffic here is heavy leading to high demand for storage facilities. The Chairman said that the Co. was actively considering expanding capacity & would share info as & when it had something concrete to report. He however mentioned that the Co. was in any case looking to further increase existing capacity by increasing the height of the tanks where ever possible. A word about the business. The demand is so strong that the lessees / tenants themselves are willing to fund capacity increase, repayable against the future rentals! The last phase of expansion at JNPT was so funded. Being a high margin business, the tanks pay for themselves in about 4-5 years. Thereafter, it becomes an annuity business to perpetuity! The other business is chemicals. This business requires large working capital. I guess having burnt their fingers in the past, the mgt. is perhaps cautious about increasing debt. The Co. is in the process of de-merging the two businesses as there are no synergies between them. The Chairman was hopeful of de-merger by the end of the financial year & was also considering a slump sale if it took longer.

With this settlement, the contingent liabilities will stand reduced to under 20 crs which given the scale of the companys operations & cash flows is very much in the comfort zone. The other factor affecting valuations have been the issue of pledged shares. This too should be resolved in the coming months.

The report predicts the global benzoic acid market to exhibit a sturdy 5.92% CAGR over the forecast period (2018-2023), rising from a value of USD 868 million in 2017 to USD 1,219 million by the end of the forecast period in 2023. Benzoic acid is a carboxylic acid with the chemical formula C6H5COOH. It has various functional properties, including antifungal and antibacterial properties, which have made it popular in a number of end-use industries. It is naturally found in a number of fruits, including plums, prunes, cranberries, and raspberries, and is primarily used in the food and beverage, chemical, and pharmaceutical industry. Get a Free Sample Now@ https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/sample_request/1119 The growing use of benzoic acid in personal care products and cosmetics is likely to be a major driver for the global benzoic acid market over the forecast period. Benzoic acid and salicylic acid are often used in conjunction to counter the threat of fungus, as they both have excellent antifungal properties. The increasing demand for well-crafted and effective personal care products, especially in developing economies round the world, is likely to be a major driver for the global benzoic acid market over the coming years. Growing demand from the food and beverage industry is likely to be a major driver for the global benzoic acid market. Benzoic acid and its sodium, potassium, or calcium salts are used as a food preservative due to their effective antifungal property. The growing demand for preserved and packaged food from the global consumer demographic is likely to drive the demand for effective natural preservatives such as benzoic acid. Plasticizers derived from benzoic acid, i.e. benzoate plasticizers, are also likely to be a major fruitful channel for the key players in the global benzoic acid market. While phthalates are widely used as plasticizers at present, the environmental impact of the same has been adverse. This has led to a renewed interest in finding alternatives that dont hurt the environment and still fulfill the important functional criteria. Benzoate plasticizers are likely to find increasing demand in the global plastics market over the coming years, driving the demand from the global benzoic acid market. Segmentation: The report segments the global benzoic acid market on the basis of application, end use, and region. On the basis of end use, the global benzoic acid market is segmented into food and beverage, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and others. The food and beverage industry registered the strongest share in the global benzoic acid market in 2017 and is likely to grow at the highest growth rate over the forecast period due to the growing demand for packaged food and beverages. It is expected to exhibit a robust 6.3% CAGR over the forecast period. By application, the global benzoic acid market is segmented into sodium benzoate, potassium benzoate, benzyl benzoate, benzoate plasticizers, alkyd resins, benzoyl chloride, feed additives, and others. In accordance with the dominance of the food and beverage industry in the global benzoic acid market, sodium benzoate, the derivative of benzoic acid used as a preservative in the food and beverage industry, is likely to remain the dominant contributor to the global benzoic acid market over the forecast period. The segment accounted for 32% of the global benzoic acid market in 2017. It is touted to exhibit a strong 6.64% CAGR to reach a size of USD 406.9 million by 2023. Regional Analysis: By region, the global benzoic acid market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. Asia Pacific dominated the global benzoic acid market in 2017 and is likely to remain in the lead over the forecast period due to the growing demand from the emerging economies in the region. The Asia Pacific market accounted for close to 47% of the global benzoic acid market in 2017 and is likely to rise to a valuation of USD 588.9 million by 2023. Europe is the second largest regional segment of the global benzoic acid market and is likely to reach a valuation of USD 312.5 million by 2023 at a CAGR of 5.53% during the forecast period.

Management should let us know what is this new trading thing is happening and how it is affecting balance sheet. Job Work segment is very old segment they have mentioned it few times in their AR but nothing more on it except its mention in AR and now suddenly it crops up as significant revenue stream. Now its looks that Chemical division will be responsible for future growth in bottom-line at-least for time being. No news on expansion or acquisition of LST biz is disappointing. Their should be some management commentary on biz segments it gives confidence to normal retail investors like us. No growth in pure LST as most of the incremental revenue is of trading and job work and if we compare YOY and remove trading and job work the profit has gone down in LST. No significant reduction in borrowing as compare to last year. In this hard times if company is trying to do something different from their core competency and blocking capital is not good in my opinion. One more thing we have to consider that company is still not paying taxes once it will start bottom line will be significantly low.

The companys topline, although increased from INR 170.40 crore in FY18 to INR 212.60 crore in FY19 due to an increase in the manufacturing division, continues to remain modest. The company has achieved INR 179.80 crore in 9MFY20, owing to the increase in demand for storage containers arising from the oil production crisis which saw an overproduction of oil due to disputes between Russia and Saudi Arabia as neither of the countries could come to a common standing on pricing of oil which lead to over-production as demand was cut due to the coronavirus pandemic leading to excess supply and a drastic decline in oil prices. It is an indicator that LST division profits should be better than earlier.

The heartening part is that this turnaround looks sustainable. The raw materials, Magnesium Oxide & Toluene, are linked to crude & its prices have come down. The finished products were priced based on the landed price of imports, mainly from China. This is where the Co. has benefited enormously. With uncertainty around Chinese supplies in the forseeable future, the importing firms will never fully depend on them. The net result is that the chemical segment which was a laggard not so long ago, has also started contributing handsomely to the bottom line. The LST division continues to do well on the whole. The trading income was more of a one time thing spread over two quarters. Q4 of 18-19 & Q1 of 19-20. The margins in this are negligible & perhaps this was done more to accommodate an old client. The Works contract (largely Steel fabrication) business is only now gaining momentum & perhaps the Co. could treat is as a separate segment going forward. Perhaps it is better not focus too much over the nitty gritty as it could lead to a missed opportunity. The LST division will continue to be the main money spinner for the Co., but currently its capacity is fully utilized, & any top line growth is linked to rate increase. I believe that is something that is currently playing out due to limited Port storage space & high demand. The capacity increase is limited to increasing the height of the existing tanks. What the current year will do is to improve the quality of the balance sheet with largely reduced debt levels. In addition, the Co. could increase earnings decently in 2020-21.

It helps to know your views and gives us confidence to know that you believe its a minor irritant.  I hope too that this is just a temporary blip and not a speed-bump to expansion plans.  My concern comes from the past trend of how the management typically moves lethargically at snails pace on execution. The Goa LPG storage plan for instance. They floated the plan in 2012 and applied for environmental clearance in the same year. They got the approval in May 2014.  Three years later, in 2017, they tried to obtain CRZ clearance on basis of the Environmental Clearance received in 2014. The Environmental Clearance approval received was valid only for 5 years, till May 2019. Havent been able to find documents showing the current status of the environmental approval. I hope it has not lapsed already, since that may mean another long wait for the approval, all over again. Delay in LPG project may be justified on financial grounds, as the companys finances during 2012 to 2016 were in doldrums, and then onwards, it was under BIFR revival plan, so may not have had the liberty to allocate capex for that project. It also failed to attract any financial / strategic investor during this period, probably due to BIFR status or the fact that no investor would want to invest funds till businesses were not demerged / restructured to insulate them from loss making chemical business. Despite the situations, 8 years is a long time for a project to take off, especially if it carries a superior revenue realisation and profitability potential (as noted in a post detailing notes from AGM 2018, on this thread) Logically, management priority should be to fortify the business by adding high yielding assets. So I hope this expansion issue at JNPT does not turn into a long drawn wait due to inaction of the management, and that they move fast to fix it in quick time.

Replies to this post will further clear my understanding if i got it wrong. I would like to put in points  Standalone Deferred tax is 18 crore, consolidated is 22.4 crore (means stolt paid 4.4 crore tax) and net loss for Stolt is 2.5 crore (i.e profit after tax) it means PBT is 2 crore. If we just extrapolate quarterly number for Stolt then Revenue comes around 40 crore yearly and 8 crore PBT. Company able to got its Other Financials Assets from 19 crore to 9 crore this year end These were due last year also  image19201080 403 KB   Net cash flow is 62 crore impressive because if we go by the Trading and Manufacturing nature of biz which is 50% of total turnover this quarter is capital heavy and can easily block capital equal to turnover. lnvestments in Bank Deposit/Mutual Funds/Equity Shares have gone up to 19 crore from 0 last year. Current account balance 10 crore up from 3 crore.  So overall results are robust my only concern remained is the Trading and Manufacturing biz. How much they want to scale it up and how much ROCE it could give? To dig more about profitability of Manufacturing/ Trading we need to compare YOY results of past years.

Domestic sales are 56% while exports are at 44%. The promoter is Mr. Hemchand Gala. Some of the directors are closely associated with Aarti Industries. Positives  The demand for this product far exceeds supply. Which is why the company is expanding capacity from 4800mt to 21600mt in a phased manner over a 3 year period. Current capacity utilisation is close to 100%. Valiant would become the market leader in India with the enhanced capacity. The financials appear to be very decent. 5 year PAT CAGR is about 27%, average 5 year ROCE is about 32%, and the ROCE last year is about 50%. The company is debt free, and the payout in 2016 (as per screener.in) is about 70% The manufacturing facility is fully integrated with almost no dependance on outside factors. The raw materials Chorine gas and phenol are readily available. The location is about 180Km from Mumbais Nhava Sheva port The product has uses in multiple industries - Agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, dyes, cosmetic and veterinary drugs The company has the ability to customise its offerings and it even charges a premium for this.

Valiants RM is Phenols and products are Chloro Phenols (mono,di). Amarjyots RM is 3,4 DCNB and PNCB (Chloro nitro benzenes) and products are para nitro anilines. Phenols are produced using Chloro Benzene and Sodium Hydroxide. Chloro Benzene itself can be produced from Benzene and Chlorine. Benzene + Chlorine -> Chloro Benzene Chloro Benzene + Sodium Hydroxide -> Phenol + Salt Now Benzene is cheaper than Phenol by about 50% and Benzene is an elementary hydrocarbon present in crude and is relatively easily available. Our own Reliance Industries which has its own petchem business produces Benzene in 3 Indian plants. Now coming to Amarjyot, lets see how nitro anilines are produced Para nitro aniline is produced via the amination of 3,4 DCNB. 3,4 DCNB + Amine -> 4-Nitroaniline + NH4Cl 3,4 DCNB is currently procured as RM by Amarjyot. It can be produced from Chloro Benzene Chloro Benzene + Nitric Acid -> 3,4 DCNB + Water Chloro Benzene itself can be produced from Benzene and Chlorine as we saw above. Chloro Benzene is an intermediate in the manufacture of both Phenol (Valiants RM) and 3,4 DCNB (Amarjyots RM) and Benzene is the base RM for both that comes from Crude. Now the company may have plans to procure benzene domestically and produce both RMs in-house to cut costs. This is just an educated guess when they are talking of synergies going by my basic understanding of Organic Chemistry. Of course equations are easy on paper but industrial production could be a completely different thing as there are lot of toxic chemicals involved in the process - Chlorine, Hydro Chloric acid, Nitric acid and intermediate wastes and probably clearances for the same but if there is any synergy in terms of integration, then this could be it.

I tried to dig deeper to access the total addressable market for PAP which is an import substitute and used as an KSM for API manufacturing of paracetamol and also comes under PLI scheme announced by GOI. Below are my findings.  Paracetamol can be prepared from benzene (key starting material) which is first converted to PNCB (para nitro chloro benzene). Then PNCB is converted into PAP (para amino phenol). PAP is widely imported from China by Indian formulation units because of a wide price margin. It is then used to make the paracetamol API and finally the tablet. (source). (Also see 4th line item in the below chart from Valiants AR)  image475544 54 KB image992560 87.2 KB   Currently India imports all 21,000 TPA of its PAP requirement from China. Although based on paracetamols capacity, Indias installed base is ~38,500 TPA.(link) July PAP pricing remained slightly high at about Rs 227 per KG. On sustainable basis we can assume it to ~Rs180-200 per KG. (see below chart)  image913563 28.8 KB  That arrives to about Rs. 400 crore of TAM for PAP (21,000 tons * Rs 190 per KG)   Now there are some important points to consider and take the discussion forward. I would request fellow VPians to add their viewpoints: a. How many other such chemical/pharma companies have ability and chemical knowhow to produce PAP from Benzene derivatives? To my understanding Aarti group is one of the leading producers of Benzene derivatives in India but request other VPians to please correct me if I am wrong. If Valiant is the sole player here (which is highly likely, given Aartis Benzene dominance in India), we can see entire Rs 400 crore of sales flowing to Valiant. That would imply asset turnover of 4x (on Rs 100 crore of capex done) which seems very high. Maybe they capture 30-50% of PAP market initially and then ramp up from there. This is all an assumption. b. We need to understand economics of these PAP and Paracetamol API products. Given PLI incentives involved, I have my doubts regarding 30+% EBITDA margin on these products (Valiants existing margin structure can come down if these are lower margin products and so can return ratios). PS: PAP looks like a very decent opportunity and can scale upto 60% of their FY20 sales. We need to be mindful of margins and working capital terms for this new business.

At any given time, we are working at 15-20 products, developing new chemistries, one ex. is that we could further integrate from BPs to make anti-oxidants. It is too premature to talk about any of them. This is what keeps us busy. Our products have a limited market size so to keep growing we need to keep adding new products. Our criterion for new products is beyond revenue potential, we have set rules:  we look for 20% ROI, it should be a clean and green process, there should be a barrier to entry through a unique process, or there is an integration for us with our existing products.  Right now our biggest endeavour is to close on PAP, one way or the other. Once we decide that, then we will make a pilot plant for the new product and go from there.

Synthesizing PAP isnt a problem as there are conventional methods available. Deepak Nitrite may also get into it as their Phenol plant may help them produce it cost effectively.   However, Vinati Organics strategy is different. They want to produce it in a greener and much cost efficient way via the catalytic hydrogenation of Nitrobenzene.

Well, what you get is a business generating 70 crores of free cash flow every year, needing no capital investment to grow, operates at 25% EBIT margins and generating a return on capital greater than 90% even when it is an operating at a capacity utilization of only 50%. Before you start thinking about the valuation, let me add a mall worth Rs 1100 crores as an additional incentive. Thats not all. The company will have cash of 130 crores by end of FY 18. Feel the dopamine rush yet? Well,lets get down to business. The company we are talking about is Grauer and Weil Limited (established 1957), dealing in surface treatment chemicals, industrial paints, engineering services and lubricants. Led by the father son duo of Umesh and Nirajkumar More, this family run company has done wonders over the last couple of decades. Let us talk about each of the divisions: Chemicals- Grauer is the market leader in the segment of surface treatment chemicals, intermediates and specialty electroplating chemicals and has manufacturing facilities in Dadra, Vapi & Jammu. The operations of the company are fully backward integrated making it very difficult for any new players to enter this segment. (Strong entry barriers, this is evidenced by the fact that there are only 3 players in the country in this business making it an effective oligopoly). The revenues from this business are 300 crores (FY17), EBIT is 77 crores ( margins exceeding 25% ) and capital employed only 85 crores. (ROCE of 90%). The most important point amidst all these figures is that this is at a capacity utilization of only 45-50%,thus company could effectively double its revenues without incremental capital investment. The market size in India is 750 crores (giving Grauer a 40% market share), which is growing at 8-10% (in line with nominal GDP). As for breakup between price and volume growth, price hikes are roughly 5-6% per annum. The domestic market is largely saturated. With regards to exports, this being a service oriented industry, the company would need to establish service centres in every country it wishes to enter. Aviation business (read attached Business India article for further details) will be small in terms of revenues, but a high margin business since these are specialised components. Competitors include Atotech and Artek Ltd (this company is spearheaded by Goenka family who were erstwhile partners of Grauer and Weil Ltd). Grauer is one of only four companies in the world which have the capability to provide such service (as claimed by the management). This is thus one of the few businesses possessing high asset turnover and high margins. The total investments in plant and machinery are only Rs 42 crores, on which company generates Rs 300 crores of revenue. Paints- In 2008, promoters merged Bombay Paints Limited with Grauer, which is now a 65 crore business. The company has shifted focus from conventional industrial paints to specialised paints which cater to pipeline coating, underground/underwater pipeline coatings, and so on. There is significant revenue growth potential in this segment and long term operating margins should be between 10-15% (as guided by the management). The company has shifted operations from Chembur to Dadra (Capex of Rs 8-10 crores). Capacity at Dadra plant is close to 8700 KL per annum and company plans to operate at 50% capacity utilisation in FY18.This business has now broken even, and management is confident of reaching 200 crores of revenue in the next 3 years. It is the first chemical and paints to receive certification from Rolls Royce and is in process of validation for Boeing for supply of specialized coatings. Rolls Royce has also approved Grow Space Aqueous cleaner. This business has underperformed so far, behaving more as a capital guzzler as capital employed is Rs 90 crores and operating profits in FY 17 was only Rs 3 crores. Engineering- The engineering division offers turnkey solutions for effluent treatment. GWIL has a plant of Alandi, near of Pune that manufactures all types of equipments used in surface finishing and allied industries. Revenue in FY 17 was 32 crores and operating profits were 3 crores. This is an offshoot of the chemicals business and is lumpy in nature. Aviation will be a focus area where significant growth is possible. This business though not very big, has the advantage of being extremely capital efficient as capital employed is only 9 crores. Lubricants- Grauer has ventured into manufacturing specialized lubricants and oils at two plants  one in Vapi and Baroti (Himachal Pradesh) producing industrial lubricants such as rust preventives, cutting oils, hydraulic oils, heart treatment oils etc. The current size of the business is only 10 crores, operating profits of 2 crores and capital employed of 3.5 crores. The management expects to see good growth going forward. Real Estate- The company owns and operates a mall going by the name of Growels 101 in Kandivali, Mumbai. The mall has 4,30,000 square feet( 10 acres) of retail development with 90% occupancy. Revenues this year should be in the range of 32  35 crores (almost entirely cash profits since unrecovered common area maintainence is only 0.5 crores-As per AS 17 disclosure, operating profits are 13-14 crores due to depreciation on mall building). Personal visits to the mall have revealed a mall that has been built very well( though utilisation of space could have been done much better in terms of the structure of the mall) Anchor tenats include PVR(a cinema hall is a must for a successful mall), Croma and central. Others include Mcdonalds and starbucks. Average rental in mall is Rs 87 per sq ft (exclusive of CAM and property taxes). This includes both fixed rentals and revenue sharing contracts with most lessees. Now coming to an interesting development- Grauer has utilised FSI of 1.16 as against the currently permitted 1.33 (ex TDR) and 1.85 (Including TDR). This is now expected to go up to 3.5-4 with the announcement of new DC rules, thereby creating an opportunity to further develop 10 lakh square feet. Yes, you read that correct. Management is cognizant of these expected changes, and has prepared complete business plan for multi use development and has been in discussion with various developers and PE players. They are most likely planning to develop a hotel or commercial complex where the JV partner would bring in substantial portion of cash investment required and Grauer would contribute land as equity component. In the nearby area, a little bit of scuttle has revealed that Kalpataru has launched a project with a commanding price of 13,000-15,000 per square foot. This means that post development, the entire developed complex would sit at 14,00,000 square feet. Do calculate market value of this at 13000 per sq ft. I leave you to draw your own conclusions regarding this Is that all you might ask? Well, one final thing. The company has a 99 year lease on 2 acres of prime Chembur land which currently houses only the R & D centre. This can be developed at the appropriate time ( Just as an indicator, current market value would be around 200 crores ) Valuation ( purely my estimates, subject to error) Chemicals-1500 crores (Great business with low growth (reminds me of Sees candies). Could be valued at a PE of 25x, considering extraordinary ROCE and sustainable earnings power) Engineering-50 crores	(Considering minimal capital requirements of the business, should trade at a high multiple of                                                       earnings. The business should enjoy robust growth over the next few years and hence would probably trade at a high   multiple) Paints	This is the business where maximum capital has been deployed and is as yet unproven. Should be valued at slight premium to book value	120 crores Lubricants	Small business, has a large headway of growth in the future,low capital requirements	30 crores Real Estate	Currently rental yields are low and mall is slated to generate about 32-35 crores per annum. The annual growth will be in the range of 7-8%,at cost of capital of 13-14% for this business, valuation should be 32/(14-7)%	450 crores Cash	By FY18 end 	130 crores Total		2280 crores Please note that this does not take into account a single rupee of upside from the new DC rules, which as discussed above will be substantial. The promoters come across as conservative capital allocators who are looking at steadily growing the company in the right manner. They have consciously repaid most of the outstanding debt in the last few years and have avoided any value destructive acquisitions. They remain focused on value creation instead of empire building (a favourite for most Indian promoters). Risk Factors: Key man risk: As with a lot of promoter run companies, even Grauer faces a key man risk in the event of any misfortune befalling the More family. Product obsolescence: I will be the first person to admit that my understanding of the business technicals is fuzzy at best and hence will leave you to take a call on this This is my understanding of the business, could definitely be wrong.

So, firstly warm welcome. Appreciate your efforts towards sharing your point of view about this stock and its super exciting future prospects.However, i had a look at this counter few days back and my mental maths is pointing differently. Even other wise, I am getting a feeling that this business case has not been presented in a balanced manner. with plenty of avoidable/uncalled for bold formatted text etc. Lets reconcile:  image.png830161 5.6 KB  Biggest workhorse that I see here is chemical segment with ~70% contribution. Look at the growth rate 5%. Just inquisitive, what was the constrain for them for a more accelerated growth considering this as a oligopoly business with strong entry barriers. Capacity for sure was not a constrain since by your own admission they have 45%ish utilization level. Is it not right to say that they are operating in a specialty per say however the overall market size is just that much hence no biggies bothering much. Engineering segment is going down consistently for past three years. Top it up with consecutive loasses for past two years. Segment wise positive with 2.93 Cr. as segment result only this year (this is how they term it on AR, my guess it close approximation of segment OP). Looking closely what i see is that there was other income of 2.3 Cr. out of this. Paint segment: Agree few things has started moving well here. 14% top line growth. Hope it sustains the segment result margin of 8% going forward. For past two years this was a loss making unit. Shop-Entertainment- This segment accounts for 6% of total revenue. After witnessing de-growth last year it has improved now. Decent margins of ~53%.  image.png755161 3.98 KB  Few questions, will appreciate if you can answer:  From where do you arrive at the ROCE of 90%.? On page 18 of the AR company finds their ROCE to be 22.3% My calc on Screener fetched data is giving me ROCE of 23.76. How come such huge gap?      Anirudh72:  (ROCE of 90%).    I am seeing an asset turn of maximum 1.05 during last 10 years. should that be considered as one of the highest asset turn over company?      Anirudh72:  This is thus one of the few businesses possessing high asset turnover and high margins.    FY17  Shop-entertainment segment revenue is 25 Cr. Please help understand why there will be a 30-40% jump in top line this year where its already going by 90% occupancy by your assessment.      Anirudh72:  Revenues this year should be in the range of 32  35 crores    Without going into plausibility and time line attached for this to have any material impact, I am concerned if we should factor that in though there is no single indication towards the same intent in the AR.      Anirudh72:  opportunity to further develop 10 lakh square feet. Yes, you read that correct.    In context of the facts (top line, bottom line numbers) and reason-ability, will appreciate if you can enlighten how you are arriving at the valuations. Specifically, for paint segment valuation of 120 Cr deserves some justification knowing that the current year OM is 5 Crs after two consecutive years of losses.

On reading the post again, totally accept the fact that it comes out as overbullish and have skipped over some of the concerns which have been well pointed out by you. Chemicals growth has been subdued due to relative saturation of domestic market- Hence expect growth in line with nominal GDP growth.This may well get a filip with the new opportunities prevalent in the aviation segment ,where the company has recently received AS9100 Aerospace certification,enabling it to supply products to the global aerospace industry.They have received approval from Rolls Royce and Go Air.(Do read attached Business Article for more granular information)Article of Grauer & Weil India  Ltdpdf (751.6 KB) (Encourage everyone to go through regardless of your views on the company) Domestic market size is small and in my view, it is a good thing that no biggies concentrating on it since we can expect ROCE to remain high in this segment.(In simplified terms,we could consider it to be an annuity sort of business) Engineering- Thanks for point out the other income of Rs 2.3 crores,that slipped past me.H1 revenue growth has been sharp(100% growth YoY) though reasons for lower profitability need to be investigated. I am less concerned about this segment than the paints segment since there is no need to deploy capital. Paints- This for me would be the acid test for the company. The annual trends may be less relevant in this case,since they have recently shifted operations to Dahej from Chembur which should aid in operational cost savings. They have managed to continue with sales momentum in H1(with 14% growth) though margins have gone down Next few quarters should be closely watched Shoppertainment - Margins of 53% not fully indicative of cash flows since about half of the expenses are actually depreciation(Depreciation should be approx Rs 5 crores and maintainence capex is only around Rs 1 crore) Your Questions:  My apologies for not making it clearer, I was referring to the chemicals business when I spoke about the 90% ROCE. Chemicals PBIT in FY17 was Rs 76 crores whereas capital employed is Rs 85 crores,thus the figure of 90%  2.This comment was specifically pertaining to the chemicals segment. The fixed assets schedule mentions that plant and machinery was Rs 42 crores, whereas chemicals revenues are Rs 300 crores ( do note that part of plant and machinery would be for paints as well) In fact, Rs 145 crores out of the Rs 210 crores of fixed assets are actually invested in land and building. Hence core business with assets of Rs 65 crores and revenues of Rs 400 crores+ has implied asset turnover of more than 6x ( Ive found spreadsheet modelling counterproductive in these kind of situations )  I will point you to H1 results where revenues from shoppertainment segment are more than Rs 15 crores.This has come about since lease agreements have been renegotiated with certain anchor tenants and increase in occupancy from 85% to approx 94%. Hence,taking all of these factors into account, I estimate revenues of around Rs 32-35 crores  4.Though there is no mention in the AR,this was certainly discussed in the AGM and the management has given detailed replies on potential plans in this space including development opportunities and appointment of a JV partner 5.Chemicals has been valued considering cash flows of Rs 75 crores this year,cost of capital of 12% and growth of 7% (75/(12%-7%)) Cash flows for this segment have been arrived at considering CFO/EBITDA of 100% (for the company as a whole it is 100%,should be more for this segment but let us take this as a base) Given that: EBIT=76 crores Depreciation=6 crores EBITDA=82 crores CFO=82*100%=82 crores Capex=5-7 crores FCF=75-77 crores Thus value=75/(12%-7%)=1500 crores Growth in my view should be 7% however you may work with your own estimates. Cost of capital for this segment in particular should be 12% considering risk free rate of 7% and 5% risk premium (I have not used CAPM)-5% risk premium seems appropriate given that it is debt free and a stable mature business so risk of detoriaration is low For engineering value of 50 crores is considering revenues of 32 crores in FY17, and Rs 20 crores in H1.Agree that is not profitable yet, but also doesnt require much capital to function. Hence in my view if traded as a standalone business,could trade at a valuation of approx 50 crores.Alternatively you may work with a lower number but this forms just 2-3 % of the company valuation As for paints,this is one business where I admittedly struggled to value. H1 revenues were Rs 37 crores (Q2 was actually net off GST ,so gross revenues would be higher),we can expect Rs 75-80 crores revenue in FY18. This is one business where I have given higher weightage to the managements targets and future potential than actual current data. If this business does scale up to 200 crores in the next 2-3 years ,with operating margins of 10% they would generate operating profits of 20 crores and then 120 crores would seem cheap.Admittedly,this is nowhere close to perfect and perhaps too bullish,but if you can give me a better indication of its actual value I would love to hear your thoughts. Also,in terms of valuation contribution to the entire entity, it forms just 5% of my total valuation estimate and hence may not be as material in terms of the context of the entire company Real Estate - In my view, I have been very conservative since I have simply calculated the value of the lease rentals from Growels 101-considering FY19 rentals of 35 crores,cost of capital of 14%(higher than that for chemicals due to higher risk) and growth of 6-7%(this is in line with average rental increments) 35/(14%-7%)=500 crores  Thanks for pointing this out.Absolutely agree that previous year has significant write offs(Rs 8 crores as per cash flow statement)In FY 17 this was Rs 2 crores. Do look at sundry balances written back of Rs 2.6 crores in FY16 and Rs 1 crore in FY17 and bad debts recovered of Rs 1.45 crores and Rs 0.2 crores respectively-these are part of other income)This is approx 10-15% of write offs My view on this is that current level of receivables is Rs 65 crores and hence even if we take around 10% as bad debts,there is no material impact in terms of valuation. However, this is definitely a concern and one I did not pay sufficient attention to.  Finally,one more thing I did realise on rereading the post is that I have missed out on talking about one of the most important things-the deployment of the excess cash that is now being generated post repayment of debt. As of now this has been deployed in mutual funds and FDs which denotes subpar returns on incremental capital invested.Hence,the real estate opportunity viewed in this light becomes all the more interesting since the company would probably decide to invest part of this into real estate. Certain back of the envelope calculations: Construction cost should be Rs 8000 per square foot(this includes Rs 3000 of actual construction costs and Rs 4500 for purchase of TDR to get the benefit of additional FSI) This entails an investment of Rs 800 crores for 10 lakh square foot. In a 50-50 JV, the company would need to invest Rs 400 crores(majority portion will be the land brought in by the company,will leave it up to you to each ones individual estimates of land value) Considering development of a hotel/commercial complex, at an average rent per square foot of Rs 100-120(considering this would be 3-5 years down the line),lease rentals would be Rs 100-120 crores per year(companys share of Rs 50-60 crores). Since the company has put down limited capital, this would be a substantial kicker. (PAT in FY 17 was Rs 51 crores) Ofcourse these are all probabalistic estimates dependent on rule changes hence have not taken the same into account when valuing the company. Do note that the mall itself would be valued at Rs 1100 crores by itself if it was sold as is.However,due to prevalence of low yields on property in India,valuing it using the lease rentals currently generated,value would be Rs 450-500 crores depending on WACC and growth estimates Certainly the part pertaining to new FSI rules can be considered as wishful thinking but that is precisely why I have not taken a rupee of that potential upside into consideration when valuing the company. So hence in that sense if you are comfortable with the remaining part of the valuation exercise now,this is like an option with substantial upside and limited downside Also,if these new rules do not materialise due to some reason(unlikely,but anything is possible in our country),the management may look to increase shareholder payout or go for a buyback in case they feel that the business is selling below intrinsic value. In either case,that is a good move for shareholders. Promoter holding is at 69% and hence any decision to increase  payouts to investors would be in their interest as well Script has run up in a short period of time and could definitely correct as and when we see a market correction. But I would be more worried about how the business does rather than worry about short term market price fluctuations.

Please note that I have small tracking position in the company and my views may be biased. There is also possibility of some misunderstanding at my end while writing notes. Future investors are expected to do their own due diligence. Business Segment: The Company business broadly comprises two business segments i.e. Real Estate and Manufacturing. Manufacturing further have 4 verticals, Metal Finishing, Engineering, Paints and Lube. Real estate comprise 101 Mall located at Kandivali East. Kandivali Real Estate Based on new DP plan, the Kandivali Land Technical development potential is around 1.9 mn sq. ft. However, the development would include cost of FSI purchase from BMC and given current market condition, there is limited scope to absorb the full development in the neighborhood market. The company has planned to do development in phases. In first phase, it intend to spend around 120 Cr over 2-3 years for developing 750,000 Lakh sq. ft., additional area of which Rs 75 Cr  would spent in FY19. The company would continue to watch market condition, cash flow position and then decide development of real estate in phases. It does not intend to leverage balance sheet significantly and do real estate development. Currently nearly 97% available area (around 50% mall area, as other half is for parking and lobbies/staircase/washroom) is currently leased out. The company get average lease of around Rs 95/ sq. ft. per month. The tenant cost is further higher as it needs to pay for maintenance and other charges. The recent lease renewals are at around 130-140 per sq. ft. per months. If one considers only WDV of building, then current mall ROCE would also be in range of 25%. The company is confident to renting out 7 Lakh sq. ft. which it would be developing over next three years given the current demand in Kandivali/Borivali Area. Chembur Land Chembur Land was previously used for Paint manufacturing. With commencement of Dadra Plant, Chembur Land is currently being utilised for Research center. The company has 3 plots with total area of around 2.5 Acres. All three plots are on leasehold term of 99 years, of which ~50 years period is remaining. Since the Land of the company are classify as Z Zone by BMC, it would not be simple just to do commercial development. The company may explore exiting this Land in case appropriate commercial offer is available. Manufacturing Business Chemical/Metal Finishing The company is market leader in Surface Treatment /Metal Finishing business with around 40% market share with estimate market size of around RS 1000 Cr. The company is  the largest player with Goenka and another group (not remembering the name) is other two organised players with 15-20% market share each. Balance market is scattered among unoganised/small players. The margin in Metal Finishing business is around 15-17% at net level which is sustainable. The growth in industry is generally in line with Nominal economy. However, Industrial production is main driver for growth. Automobile is main contributor accounting for around 30% of end use, while Auto component is further 10% and Imitation Jeweler being around 5-10% of total endues. There are multiple endues sector which account for balance 50% of market. The ROCE achieved in the business are upwards of 50%+. The industry is however not very high growth. The company sales nearly 80-85% sales through distributors which nearly no receivable days. The company has enjoyed market share of around 40% over last 4 decades and it is undisputed leader in this segment. In aviation, the chemical of the company used  as maintenance chemical for Engine and also used in technical component. The company has been operating in Defense aerospace for around 15 years and has strong relationship with Boeing and Airbus.  In fact, the company earned small royalty income of Rs 12.89 Lakhs during FY18 from JV with Boeing for some development work. The business is Niche cash flow generating with high ROCE and Margin but with moderate growth potential. Exports The company has been exporting only Chemical manufactured product. South East Asia and SAARC countries are focus area for export development. However, the company experience to set up Subsidiary in China was not good. It has decided to close Chinese subsidiary and restore old distribution driven sales for Chinese market. The company would approach neighbour countries as client servicing is critical success factor for Metal finishing business. Setting up proper team in unknown country is very challenging. Engineering The engineering business is more of support to chemical business to fulfill specific client requirement. Hence, standalone margin and return would continue to remain moderate. The company would continue to fulfill demand of existing customers, but do not intend to aggressively expand in this segment given poor profitability parameter. Industrial Paints While the margin in Paints business is lower than Chemical business, the growth opportunity is higher. Hence, company has spent around 14-15Cr on Dadra plant for industrial paint for 5000 KL Capacity. The company intends to spent further Rs 4-5 Cr to increase capacity by 50% i.e. total 7,500 KL by end of 2018. The expansion is likely to be completed in 2-3 months. The company is also exploring option to acquire Industrial paint units to double its capacity subject to appropriate prices. The management is targeting 65% volume growth and has achieved around 50% growth in first five months. In Dadra plant, the company has employed around 181 employees. The management team is also in place for taking business to next level. However, net profit margin (~5-7%) and return in this business would be lower than chemical business. It took around 4 years for the company to turnaround paint business which was loss making. Further, the company is leveraging its client relationship in Chemical business to grow paint business. The leverage client relationship is core of the company strategy in manufacturing, and all its segments, the company is present due to client requirement. The working capital requirement for Paint business is also higher than chemical business. Hence, as share of Non-chemical manufacturing business in total revenue increased, net profit margin and ROCE from manufacturing business is likely to decline. Industrial Lube The company also has presence in industrial lube which is relatively lesser competitive business. While the size is small, it is something similar to Paint business 3-4 years back, when due to lower scale, the company was reporting losses. It intends to turnaround Lube business in couple of years and then wanted to scale up like it is attempting in Paint. Capacity utilisation At present, average capacity utilisation manufacturing plant is around 50-51% which provides revenue of around Rs 500 Cr. It would be difficult to achieve 100% capacity utilisation given the unique requirement and client specification. However, the company expects it can operate at peak level of around 75% utilisation which could give around Rs 700-750 Cr sales at current prices. Financials The company reported higher consultancy and legal charges as many senior people, who retired from job, were appointed as consultants. In Q4FY18, the company reported lower margin, as it tried to gain market share. One of its competitors was facing financial problem and company took tactical decision to compromise in profitability by passing on cost increase and gain market share. In Q1FY19, it resumed its profitability level again. While management was confident to achieve high sales growth shown in Q1FY19 during the year, on profitability, it would depend on volatility in Oil and exchange rate. In my opinion, the company is trying to use cash flow from highly profitable-moderate growth Chemical business (Cash cow) to high growth business like Real estate, Paints and Lube which would drive growth in years to come.

Had a couple of things to add - Cost for expansion of 750000 square feet of the mall will be Rs 400 crores to be incurred over 3 years. Rs 120 crores would imply a construction cost of only Rs 1600 per square feet which is too low. Also, to avail the additional FSI the company would need to pay a cost to the government in the form of TDR at the rate of Rs 4500 per sqaure foot for the leasable area being constructed. Out of this expansion of 750000 square foot, roughly half will be leasable.

Please note that these are based on my understanding and interpretation of the proceedings, shared here in good faith. But there could be errors and omissions. This is not a recommendation to buy or sell the stock. I am invested in the company and my views may be biased. Please do your own research before investing. The management freely invited shareholders to come up to the podium & ask questions. Later most of the questions were answered with lot of specific details and numbers. Management mingled with the shareholders for a long time after the meeting was over.   Company is debt free, debt is zero. If you are seeing any debt it might have been taken for some short term transactional purposes, but otherwise there is no debt.   Margins: At a company level, margins will be lower in future due to 2 reasons viz. there is increasing competition and product profile is changing. Paints business is lower margin and its contribution will increase going ahead.   Subsidiaries: All our subsidiaries are profitable.   Capacity Utilization: Current capacity utilization at the company level is 55% on average, with individual plants ranging from 30 - 60 %. All our 6 divisions are profit making.   Automobile sector: Our exposure to automobile sector is around 15% of total revenues.   Capex: We have decided to go slow on capex since there is a slowdown. We are conserving cash. Right now, we do not want to invest if we are not sure of the returns. Capex plan for this year is Rs.57 crore. Going ahead, there will be more capex in manufacturing and less on property development. In Dadra, we have purchased a factory costing Rs.17 crores of which Rs.10 crores is for Land and Rs.7 crore is for the plant & machinery. In addition, we have purchased a small property in Vasai costing Rs.7 crore where the Tech centre for R & D will be shifted from Chembur. This will become functional in another 18 months.   Fire incident: Major part of the loss was stocks. That is why you are not seeing any reduction in the Fixed Assets. We have lodged an insurance claim for Rs.14 crores, of which around Rs.4 crores has already been received as an advance.   Electroplating: This is the cash cow, but it is a saturated market with around Rs.900-1,000 crore market size in India. We are already a market leader and hence double digit growth is not possible in this.   Paints: This will propel the growth in future. New capacity for Paints is coming up in the first half of next year. In Paints, we are focussed in highly specialised industrial paints where technology is the main driver and not marketing. Right now, we are majorly into Oil & Gas, Pipelines, Infrastructure, Defence, Space etc. We are approved vendor for works on Sukhoi, MiG, Rafael (in progress), PSLV, BrahMoS etc. We are trying to get into Commercial Aviation which will be big once we get it. We are also trying to get into Railways. The paints business works on approvals - becoming an approved vendor is costly and time consuming. But once you are an approved vendor, orders are large in size. For example, we got an ONGC order recently for Rs.28 crore. Paints business is more working capital intensive. There is pressure on working capital since they (government / PSUs) release payments with delays & all. Paints business will have higher volume but lower margins, leading to higher absolute profits for the company. In Paints, we have grown very fast in the last couple of years compared to the competition. Why have we been so successful in Paints? There are two reasons. One, we are cost competitive compared to the competition, many of which are expensive MNC players. Two, we are excellent in service - both pre & post sale servicing. We have a very good team. Main competition in paints are - Indian (Shalimar Paints, Berger Paints) and many MNCs like Akzo Nobel etc.   Real Estate Development: We have large plans in this but they are dampened due to constant change of rules. We can get around 11 lac square feet FSI. But FSI has become very costly, so it is not worth investing right now when market conditions are not favourable. Options to develop Chembur land are very limited due to its size and location. But some decision on this may come up in near future. We are planning to develop 4 lac square feet in the current mall, and are waiting for clearances. Metro work on the WE Highway is expected to go on till 2022. We also have a small share in Pune property which is under development.   Oils: Our current sales in these are small but this business also has a lot of potential. Even these are ultimately surface treatment products only.   Royalty payments: Last year there was some royalty income due to a project from Boeing. That project is over and hence this year there is no such income.   Listing on NSE: We feel there will be no value addition due to NSE listing. On the other hand, it will increase costs and compliance burden. Hence we are not interested in NSE listing at this stage. We may go for listing in future if we have to raise money from the market or some such reason but right now we dont see any tangible benefit.

From the latest Annual Report, I find that Grauer & Weil (G&W) has sold its 91,960 shares of PBCL and exited the company totally.  Though the AR does not clearly say so, it appears from Other Income and Cash Flow Statement that the sale has been done at PBCLs Face Value of Rs.100 per share, fetching the company Rs.92 lacs and an accounting profit of Rs.88 lacs. But how much is PBCL really worth? Back in the early 2000s, G&W held a 77.22% stake in PBCL. At that time, PBCL was a profit making company, had no debt and owned a large piece of land near Pune. The company planned to develop the land into an I.T. Park. But in FY2007, G&W sold 49,980 shares of PBCL @ Rs.83.40 per share, reducing its stake to 50.78% (in favor of whom is not known), valuing PBCL at Rs.1.50 crore. In Oct-Dec 2009, PBCL acquired an 18.07% stake in G&W. And so, over the years as market cap of G&W has increased, PBCL has become more and more valuable. But strangely, as PBCLs value has increased, G&W has quietly reduced its stake in the company, often without adequate compensation (or at least disclosures). In FY2012, G&W sold 4,000 shares of PBCL at market value. Though G&W does not reveal the price at which the shares were sold, back-of-the-envelop calculations suggest the shares were sold for around Rs.22 lacs, valuing PBCL at Rs.10.40 crore. More importantly, the effect of this sale was that PBCL ceased to be a subsidiary of G&W with its stake coming down from 50.78% to 48.66% and became an Associate Company. In FY2015, G&W further reduced its stake in PBCL from 48.66% to 30.89%.  However, Annual Report shows the number of shares held by G&W remained the same.  This implies PBCL made a fresh issue of shares to someone else. It is not clear to whom these shares were issued, at what price, who did the valuation and why G&W was giving up its stake without getting anything meaningful in return. In FY2017, G&W reduced its stake in PBCL further to 18.27%, with the same modus operandi. At the 2017 AGM, I met Mr. Umesh More and enquired about what was happening with the companys stake in PBCL and why it was being reduced. He said something about de-risking the main company which left me unconvinced. I asked him whether there was any plan to reduce the stake further to which he did not reply. A mail sent to the company at that time went unanswered. In FY2021, G&W has exited the company completely, selling its remaining holding of 91,960 shares for just Rs.100 per share. PBCL has effectively disappeared from Grauer & Weils balance sheet. But it is safe to assume its value has increased substantially over the years. At the current market cap of  Grauer & Weil of around Rs.1,400 crore, PBCLs 18-odd percent stake in G&W itself is worth around Rs.250 crore. In addition, the large piece of land which the company can (or already has) commercially develop(ed) would be worth quite a lot. Grauer & Weils minority shareholders seem to have missed out on their rightful gains. Disclosure: Was a shareholder in the past but no positions currently.

It is very rare that any company scores well (and not only well but infact very well) in all the three aspects and in addition also has :  a reasonably good quality clean management with high promoter holding ( 74.60   % with nil pledge ) as also high institutional holding ( 15.37 % ), is a leader in its Operational Segment and has always operated at an EBITDA margin of 17 % + in its entire history, has a RoE of 24.35 % and a RoCE of 25.56 % , has given an annual growth guidance of 30 % each year over coming 3 years and  is still available at resonable valuations of just 11.9 FY12e price-to-earning (p/e) multiple and 1.3 times market-cap-to-sales ratio.     Solar Industries India Ltd. ( BSE- 532725 ; NSE  SOLARINDS ) is one such company and straightaway we will start with its assessment without discussing further.    CAGR of 79.22 % in Topline over the span of last 8 years is what is achieved by Solar Industries. If we look at just last five financial years, still, it has grown at a CAGR of 40.83 % and that too on a larger scale.     The most significant point to note here is that the CAGR of 40.83 % in topline over last 5 years has been achieved with a corresponding 26 % CAGR in actual volumes of products of the company which is a very healthy sign and signifies expanding marketplace as also increasing market-share of Solar in the segment.    EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 94.65 % over the span of last 8 fiscal years while if we take into account last 5 fiscal years, EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 55.82 %.     PAT has grown at a CAGR of 94.99 % over the span of last 8 years and the same has grown at a CAGR of 58.69 % over the span of last 5 years.    Quality of financials is healthy which is evident from the highest tax paid by the company in the industry ( at the rate of 35.5 % at PBT level and 30.36 % at EBITDA level ).    Effective Management of such healthy growth is evident from the gradual reduction of interest payment as % to EBITDA which has come down to 8.56 % (FY11), consistent high RoE and RoCE over last 4 years which stands at 24.35 % and 25.56 % (FY11) respectively as also reasonable balancing of growth and shareholder payback by ploughing back higher amount of cash generated in the initial years and gradual reduction in ploughed back money with simultaneous increase in Dividend payment over last two years. This also depicts the justice done with minority shareholders which is otherwise rare in a high promoter holding (74.6 %) company as promoters could have enjoyed the high dividend payment by sacrificing growth which is not done by the management of Solar as a result of which the company today is on verge of an expoenential growth phase even on such higher scale.    The growth has also continued in Q1FY12 with a 49.9 % YoY rise in topline, 31.7 % YoY growth in EBITDA and 39 % YoY growth in PAT.    The management has consistently achieved growth with a conservative approach towards leverage which is evident from the reasonably healthy cash levels company maintains throughout the business cycle as also 50 % under-utilisation of bank limits granted to the company because of which its instruments command a healthy rating of P1+ and AA- from CRISIL.    Companty has a planned CAPEX of Rs. 200 cr. over next two years including the current year which management is confident of financing purely with internal accruals without much increase in debt as also without any significant equity dilution.    With the planned CAPEX, management is confident of achieveing 30 % annual growth in topline with improving EBITDA margins each year over next three years including FY12.    Now, let\'s assess Solar Industries\' operational segment, its positioning in its operational segment as also future plans based on which management is confident of 30 % growth each year over coming 3 years.....Solar Industries operates in Explosives Industry which is dominated (domestic) by Orica (MNC), Gulf Oil, Indian Explosives and IBP in addition to Solar.    Solar Industries dominates the market at No.1 position with an approximate overall share of 22 % in domestic market. If we look more deeply into the sub-segments of main operational segment, then, Solar is No.1 in Cartridge Explosives, Detonating Fuse and Cast Booster and No.2 in Bulk Explosives and Detonators.    Company has always remained ahead of its peers by proactive and efficient strategy execution like backward integration into raw material manufacture (except AN) and bulk purchase and trading of main raw material AN (Ammonium Nitrate) which has given it a high operational efficiency and highest EBITDA margins in the industry (only Orica which is MNC player in India enjoys such high EBITDA margins).    The operational segment enjoys high entry barriers like industrial license requirement, clearance requirement from Home Ministry and IB, etc. because of which there is least chance of much competition emerging in the segment. As far as growth and expansion of the market segment goes, it has a very bright prospect as each of the commodity like Cement, Steel as also Power indirectly require explosives. To elaborate, 1 MnT Cement requires 1.45 MnT Limestone while 1 MnT Limestone requires 166 MT Explosives; similarly, 1 MnT Steel requires 1.70 MnT Iron Ore while 1 MnT Iron Ore requires 200 MT Explosives; to add, Per Unit Thermal Power requires 0.74 Kgs Coal while 1.00 MnT Coal requires 1080 MT of Explosives. Hence, since domestic demand for Steel, Cement, Power and Coal is not expected to slowdown significantly in foreseeable future, demand for Explosives is set to show a growing trend in near future and exponential growth thereafter.    Coal sector is atpresent the largest consumer of Explosives domestically with 70 % of that consumed by Coal India. Solar Industries is the largest supplier of explosives to Coal India and already 2011-12 tender of Coal India is through in which Solar has garnered a 8-10 % growth over last year. The contract is immune to price fluctuations in raw material with a quarterly cost-escalation clause.     Derisked business model as well as proactive management quality is evident from the fact that Coal India which contrbuted more than 40 % to Solar Industries\' revenue 5 years before is today, as of FY11, contributing only 24.79 %.    The most significant point to take note of in the business strategy of Solar over last two years is its expansion into global marketplace and its robust growth there. Exports, which were insignificant before 3 years are today, as of FY11, contributing 13.53 %.     The growth in exports is likely to strengthen considerably in FY12 and FY13 as the current exports are on back of only one plant of the company being operational in Zambia (capacity  10000 MT). Already in Q1FY12, another plant in Nigeria with similar capacity has become operational and is undergoing stabilisation and is expected to start production in Q2FY12. Construction on third plant at Turkey has commenced in the month of April 2011 and this plant in expected to start production in Q4FY12.    FY13 will be the blockbuster year as far as exports of the company are concerned and coming 3 years are expected to see an exponential jump in exports of Solar.    On the domestic front, company is planning to almost double the present capacity of each of its existing product in coming two years to cater to the rising demand of mining and infrastructure sectors.    Solar Industries also possesses a kind of Hidden Treasure in the form of its interest in two Coal Blocks, one located at Madanpur and another located at Bhatgaon. Madanpur Coal Block in which company has a 20 % interest is classified as \'No-Go\' area and a new application is made with MOFE for clearance of the same. As far as Bhatgaon Coal Block is concerned in which company has a 24.5 % share, all the formalities including Public Hearing is complete and Rehabilitation & Resettlement has been accepted. The company has already submitted revised mine closure plan and final clearance from MOFE is expected shortly after which land acquisition and development work will commence. The production from Bhatgaon block is expected to commence from FY14.    In our valuation matrix we have not incorporated any upside arising out of any of the Coal Blocks that company has interest in and have only valued upsides from the core business of the company.    In another significant development which is expected to boost already high profits margins of Solar further going forward, in Q1FY12, companty has got \'Mega Project\' status from the Government for its CAPEX at Nagpur. This status will entitle it to many tax benefits and management conservatively expects this development to add ~Rs. 10 cr. at PBT level in FY12 itself.   At current market price of Rs. 721, Solar Industries is available at a P/E of just 11.9 its FY12e earnings and at a mcap-to-sales of just 1.3 FY12e sales and at a P/E of just 9.6 and a mcap-to-sales of just 0.9 on FY13e numbers. A company with :    a RoE of 24.35 % ,    which has consistently demonstrated high growth rates with healthy EBITDA margins over last many years,    has just started scratching off huge international market by setting up manufacturing plants overseas without burdening balance sheet or any form of equity dilution,    has also forward integrated by investment into coal blocks and,    is also having a high promoter as well as institutional holding (combined comes to 89.97 %) and a low floating stock,    should actually command a scarcity premium and the whiff of the smallest positive trigger could start-off a rerating process for this company.

Hi Hitesh, PI Ind. is a great company and is very different from Solar and I must admit that we rarely get an opportunity to invest in cos. like PI at current valuations If both are compared, definetly PI will be a winner by a wide margin But while looking at cos. we cant compare them unless they are in same spaceHence, if anyone goes deepand analyses Solar from all angles then there is a chance of judging its prospect Two main things that justify the current valuation as well as future upsides are (1) 30 % growth guidance till FY14 and (2) Cos. succesful diversification overseas, especially in rich mining areas like Zambia Now, here, I must say frankly that we need to wait for Q2FY12 numbers togauge the exact prospect of this co. but if its able to achieve a topline of 210 cr. + in Q2FY12 then a significant rerating of this counter is iminent as second half is always better than first half and it will mean that it will be crossing the expected topline of 965 cr. for FY12 quite comfortably and might touch four figure sales mark this year itslef Also, because of the MegaProject status granted to the capex at Nagpur, co. has to give employment to atleast 600 labourers which itself is a sign of growth expected by the company in future and hence, 30 % p.a. growth guidance till FY14 looks achievable Now, when you have a 1000 cr. sales co. growing at, even if we dont consider 30 %, say 25 % p.a. and is trading at just 11.9 p/e FY12e EPS, it cant remain there for too long Also, in my experience over last many years, I have observed that the cos. which operate at high EBITDA margins always trade at a premium and this co. has never in its history of existence gone below the EBITDA margin of 17 % and so it deserves to trade at a forward 15 p/e which means that if the calculations that we are assuming are correct, there is minimal downside from current levels. Also, I have studied many international cos. in this space including Orica,Maxam, Enaex and the way Solar is going, within few years it will be a name to reckon with on international arena remember, out of Indias total exports of explosives, Solar contributes more than 60 % Still, Solar has just scratched the surface of the international potential considering its lack of presence in North America, worlds largest consumer of explosives So far, to start with, it has started with Africa which consumes only 7 % of global explosives, Now, till FY13 it will be venturing into Euope which consumes 11 % of global explosives The most significant thing is, all these is done without sacrificing growth, profitability as well as with confortable leverage positionThis strategy is interesting and commendable and deserves much premium valuations Thanks to all for your candid views and keep sharing your views Rgds.

Ans.- In Nigeria they have indicated potential market-size of 200 cr. + of which they do around 70 cr. (they had acquired distribution co. there so the sales dont reflect only from nigeria) In Zambia the potential market is huge as its the main mining area and new mines are being set-up there At present they are doing there only 14 cr Rgdg. FY12 they have indicated 40 cr. from Zambia, and 100 cr. from Nigeria. Rgdg. Tanzania they have not indicated anything  How many years they may need to reach 80 to 85% of capacity utilisation at these places?  It depends on many factors, but it might take roughly 1.5-2 yearsAlso, its safe to assume that such high utilisation might not be feasible as explosives is a different business and depends on mining activities which itself depends on various factors like monsoons, etc.,  Will they have same type of margins in those foreign countries also?  No Margins are better, stable in upwards of 18 % + (they indicated till 20 % for zambia in FY12) as compared to domestic 17 % +. Also, here you need to understand one thing that margins will be much superior atleast for coming 2-3 years in Africa as there is least formidable competition there and Solars management was proactive and was right in judging the future potential and so will have first mover advantage Orica, the main competitor of Solar in India has followed Solars footsteps and is now in the process of setting up 10000 MT plant in Zambia For this plant it will take few years to come up but the plant of Solar in Zambia which started in 2010 is now fully stabilised and is ready to increase utilisation levels from this year , i.e. FY12.  If local demand does not grow, then it may be difficult for the exports to add to this local shortage?  Agreed But GV I cant understand what you are thinking Are we going to come to ground-level zero on infra space Its impossible Also, the thing which you are seeing in urban area, the picture is totally different in rural area You just see there the construction projects going on the infra initiatives of Gujarat & Bihar which are slowly reaching rural area Here , I am not talking about just from the news items but with personal experience I have one servant from a far away village to patna, now he doesnt have to go via weak roads, perfect concrete road is in place and is getting constructed for reaching every villages, near his village a big power plant is being set-up, there is a labour shortage there and wages have shot up and so have his land prices and this I am talking about just latest one month before experience when he came back from native placeSimilarly, when I researched for PI and interacted with ground-level knowlege-bearing people of villages in Gujarat, a complete transformation is taking place and there are hoards of infra initiatives lined up Apart from these experiences, lets talk about figures Coal industry which consumes 70 % of explosives, lets talk about it India has the fourth largest coal reserves after US, Russia and China Indias domestic demad for Coal is rising at the rate of 11 % p.a., Indias coal imports are likely to rise more than 50 % in 2011-12 while domestic production of coal which was forecast to grow by 7-8 %, is scaled down to grow at 3-4 % for 2011-12 becuase of delay in clearncesNow, a country with 4th largest reserves has to suffice its almost 20 % domestic demand by inports, its highly unlikelyGovt. will step-up and issue clearances soon so that coal output can be increasedEven if it doesnt, a 3-4 % rise in coal production (mining) could very well mean a 10 % growth for explosives industry, specifically Solar and that is what management has indicated by garnering 8-10 % growth in coal india tender for 11-12. You see, to look at other way round India is the third largest Asian economy which is growing at 7-8 % and Coal accounts for more than half of the power generation of India Hence, coal production has to go up which will hugely benefit explosives industry Now, take the example of Steel, production of Steel has increased from 65 MTPA to 80 MTPA in 2010-11 and is forecast to touch 120 MTPA by 2012-13 This forecast is made just last weekSteel requires Iron Ore which in turn again requires explosives To just clarify here, karnataka mining ban for iron ore should not hugely affect Solar as it doesnt have operations there. Now, to come to Cement, India is the second largest Cement producing country whose production has increased to 315 MT from 300 MT this year Out of the 137 large plants and 365 odd small cement plants that India has, only large plants themselves employ 1,20,000 peopleNow, can a govt. afford slowdown here a clear no This is the reason why in a recently published report in which all the leading cement cos. were partcipants, they have forecast CAGR of 12 % for cement production in the period 2011-12 till 2013-14 Now, Cement requires limestone and limestone requires explosives The exact qty. of explosives required each for coal, limestone and iron ore are given in my research note Hence, what I want to say here is that domestic demand cant die down completely and Solar is the only company from India which has shown reselience and has grown despite all odds by proactive strategy 2008 meltdown also didnt affect this co. which can be seen from the numbers posted by the co. since last many years and on first signs of slowdown in domestic demand co. ventured overseas to sustain the high growth rate achieved by the co  Any idea what would be the difference between cartridges and bulk explosives?  Bulk Explosives, as the name suggests, are high-grade explosives used for explosion in large open cast mines whereas Cartrdge Explosives are Small and Large diameter packaged explosives which are used for small open cast mines, underground mines and infra projects Margins are better in later  SILs growth in future purely depends on Coal, Cement, Steel & Road sectors performance?  Yes but not the performance but the core growth  Who are the major competitors? What prevents their customers from shifting to them?  As mentioned in my research note also its Orica, Gulf, IBP, Keltech and Premier First and foremost the growing market-size, capacities of Solar, quality of products as also reliability and ability to deliver which is crucial Also, here I think you have not focussed on details of my research note in which i have given positioning of Solar in each of the sub-segments of industry will touch on it in your query no. 10.

Solar  ~22 % Orica  ~ 19 % Gulf  ~ 13 % IBP  ~5 % Keltech  ~5% Premier  ~4%  Are they in a position to pass on the increase in prices (even may be a after a lag)  Yes they pass on price on a quarterly lag every contract they enter into provide for that  Coal India which is a PSU is their main customer giving almost 25% of their business. Is their contracts with them allow SIL to pass on the increase in prices?  Yes since last 2 years the contract provides for a quarterly revision in prices  While it used to be quoting more than 20 PE, but after 2008 crash, it has been quoting between 18.5 to 5.65 forward PE. Assuming they will do Rs.50/-, at CMP of Rs.745/-, it is already at 15forward PE Any PE expansion is possible?  __ Well what happens GV is, in this markets you hardly find quality with growth and with both of these if we find reasonable scale then its the opportunity we need to latch on Thats why I was maintaing since last 8 months or so that PI is the safest pick in the market as it offered excellent quality with tremendous growth coupled with reasonable scale It had a unique business model and it operated at high margins and so even today I will say that if I had to invest I will first prefer PI and there is no doubt about that But, Solar is in a different space and has its own positioning in the protfolio you see it has to its side excellent growth track-record and proactive management, its expanding overseas presence is hearty, its scale near to 1000 cr. is un-ignorable and above all its consistent 17 % + EBITDA margins is the biggest assetNow, if I forget this fundamental aspects and look at technical side of it then with 74.6 % promoters holding and 15.37 % FI holding with good credible names like HDFC, Icici, Birla, Reliance, Religare and now Kotak minority shareholders like us have less to loose than themBecuase, evenif we consider that FIs buy for profits then also for exit from this illiquid counter they need to sell it as a compelling story and go for bulk as 150 cr. + investment they have made here cant be absorbed even at rate 0 Now consider the rate of their purchase This co. came with an IPO in i think 2006 at Rs. 190 and post that there is not a single equity dilution done by the co Only once it went below offer price and consistently after that it has traded above it HDFC was the lowest entrant in this co. at around Rs. 180-250 (i am considering the lowest rate based on shareholding) in 2006-07 4 years hence, evenif HDFC thinks of exiting its 9 % stake in this co. (which it has not atall intended and has infact increased exposure over last year), then also for that it needs liquidity or takers of the story Now, on ground we have in these 4 years, the growth achieved by the co. for us to see as also 30 % p.a. growth guidance given by the company till FY14 The coal block investment is a plus and when it materialises it will be a added bonus Hence, on the whiff of the smallest positive trigger, it could rerate significantly becuase of the same rangebound consolidation it has shown over last 2-3 years as such rerating is in best interest of promoters and Fis becuase of their 90 % stake in the co. On a 30 % growth and EBITDA margins of 17 % + it has to trade at a reasonable forward 15 p/e at one point of time only based on its core business, which might come soon which reaches to around 910 for FY12 and 1126 for FY13 Any positive development on coal blocks will be an added bonus and if in FY13 the discounting of Bhatgaon coal block getting operational in FY13-end or FY14 is made then it could easily overshoot the target price Having said all these, I must admit here that PI and Solar form part of my core portfolio (Solar I have invested and is still adding) and so my views have to be taken with that regards I have tried to be as genuine and as honest as possible in my replies but do your own due diligence before taking any call **Thanks for sharing your views and keep sharing Rgds**         ',NULL,'2011-08-12 15:11:20'),(8693,506,1443,'Link to Latest 12th August HDFC Sec.

I dont know why? Yes that pinched me too but I think one of the reasons might be not disclosing much to competition (I have experienced this in case of PI Ind. wherein they are refraining to talk rgdg. Nominees revenues publicly whereas all other cos. including Dhanuka and Rallis share the info in public domain) )- I heard Nigeria they have done 17Cr. Is it right? Its 70 cr. that they toldrgdg. which I have explained you in my previous reply to you )- Tanzania : when will they start manufacturing? Very uncertain as clearances are not receivedIt is safe to assume that they might drop the plan there )- They want to spend around 200cr for capex during next two years. He says all these would be from the internal accruals. Do they have so much of cashflow? **Yes they can with a mix of debt and internal accruals last fiscal they had already incurred CAPEX of around 95 cr. and managed it very well They are just utilising 50 % of the bank limits they have and so they are getting very high rating from CRISIL This year expected net has to be 100 cr. +  ** )- They have already spent 97Cr on the two blocks. While they r not sure when they will start Madanpur, Bhatgaon is expected in another two years. Any idea with which company they have the tie up? CMDC and SMS Infrastructure )- Is their entire business is on tender basis like even to private miners and others? Dont think so as CIL is a PSU so its a compulsion But, in any case private guys will go with whom will offer best quality at reasonable price )- Of the competitors names you had mentioned, anyone has better margins than Solar? If not what makes Solar to have such better margins? Orica has better margins )- Dont you think, HDFC Securities for a change has given very aggressive targets? No Still I feel KR Choksey and HDFC both are underplaying topline growth of FY12 Let Q2FY12 pass -Do they have expertise in the mining? OR since they have JV, they will supply explosives, rest will b done by the JV partners? AND )- Isnt it something similar to diworsification? Ans.- NoThey dont have core expertise in mining They will supply explosives as well as do financial investment (which is atpresent done via loans to JV) and will have specific % interest in the produce Now,  you see this is not atall diworsification but a forward integration The term Diworsification is apt for a foray into an unrelated area of core expertise but this Coal Mining is a related area of the companys core business and if it succeds in this it will be one of the few cos. in India with complete integrated operations in mining (although this is many years away as for it it will have to faray into other areas too related to mining) You should remeber that Coal sector contributes alost 70 % to the operational market demand Also, this might be a foray to acquire expertise in this area as internationally, the companies in explosives segment normally offer end-to-end solutions for mining including mining consultation and core minining If this is so then Solar could some years down the line pitch itself, nationally and internationally, as an end-to-end products and solutions provider in minining segment which will open up huge market with great margins for Solar Lastly, if this expansion would have been done by budening balance sheet or raising some form of significant equity, it could have been risky, but company has played very safe and invested the generated money into forward integration which is good for future growth and stability of the company )- They hardly make money in trading.

Indias most valuable company is not giving up. It is working on a revised limited tender document with softer conditions, and if that fails too, global tenders would be floated, chairman NC Jha said. In 2008, CIL first sought expression of interest from global mining giants to reopen 18 abandoned underground mines owned by three of its subsidiaries  Eastern Coalfields Ltd, Bharat Coking Coal Ltd and Central Coalfields  which have reserves of about 1,647 million tonne. ArcelorMittal, Rio Tinto, Reliance Natural Resources, Sterlite, JSW Steel, Monnet Ispat and Essar Steel were among those responding to the call to revive the mines where work was suspended owing to lack of technology. A parallel effort to develop underground mines on a turnkey contract basis also drew a blank due to unattractive tender conditions. Efforts are now on to rework these too. A special purpose tender document was formulated for developing seven high grade capacity underground mines. The tenders were issued to shortlisted parties. In the absence for any response from the parties, subsidiaries were advised to reframe tender documents to make them more attractive to bidders and go for open global tender. Jha said in his address to shareholders on Saturday that one subsidiary has been able to finalise bids for four underground mines. Bharat Coking Coal chairman T K Lahiri recently told _DNA _the company has awarded contracts for these four mines to foreign mining companies under mine developer and operator model and plans to invite partners for another 6-7 mines soon. Overseas, efforts are on to acquire further mines in Mozambique via its existing wholly owned subsidiary Coal India Africana Limitada. The subsidiary plans to start shortly drilling and exploration in the leasehold area over 22,400 hectares for which tenders were floated in February. Bids from interested parties, the letter said, are being evaluated. Jha said CIL is examining and evaluating 19 proposals from 5 companies in response to a global expression of interest for contract for long-term offtake of coal floated earlier while offers are being made to acquire coal blocks overseas. After an initial due diligence in association with technical consultants and merchant bankers of identified coal assets in Indonesia, Australia and US, non-binding indicative offers were sent to selected companies, Jha said in the letter.

In its approach paper to the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the commission has sought a thorough review of the current approach to the environment-versus-development debate, clearly according top priority to the countrys development agenda. At the centre of the commissions critique is the go and no-go area policy for coal blocks and the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index, or CEPI, norms adopted by the environment and forests ministry. Part of the reason for the shortfall in coal production is the implementation of tighter environment-related regulations, and problems in rehabilitation and resettlement and land acquisition, the document notes. The commission had originally targeted coal production at 680 million tonnes during the ongoing 11th plan (2007-12), but scaled it down to 630 million tonnes during the mid-term appraisal in 2010. The target was further lowered to 554 million tonnes. Coal output expanded at 7% a year during 2004-05 to 2009-10, but stagnated in the previous fiscal. In the past five years, demand grew at an average 8% and is expected to continue at the same rate during the next plan. Coal projects have struggled to get environment clearances since 2009, when the ministrys no-go classification disallowed mining in 203 coal blocks. According to a coal ministrys projection, the output from those 203 blocks, estimated at 660 million tonnes annually, could have been used to generate around 1.3 lakh megawatts of power a year. The environment ministry had adopted the policy of \'go, no-goa This would have severely impacted the ability to expand domestic production of coal, said a commission official. \"The policy had to be reviewed and now some coal blocks have been cleared. This has to be continued to ensure coal availability. In January 2010, the environment ministry imposed a temporary ban on development works, including some coal mining projects in Jharkhand and Chattisgarh in industry clusters identified under CEPI norms. CEPI is an index of 88 industrial clusters across India, ranked according to their impact on environment and was developed to plan developmental projects in tandem with environmental protection. The commission said the CEPI norms had prohibited mining in areas with high pollution index even if pollution was because of some other industry. Coal being location specific, there is clearly a need for review of this (CEPI norms) approach, the paper notes. Currently the issue is under consideration of a group of ministers headed by _Finance Minister_ Pranab Mukherjee. The commission estimates a significant rise in reliance on imported coal as it would not be possible to meet the increased demand from domestic sources. Coal imports are expected to rise to over 200 million tonnes from the current 90 million tonnes by the end of the 12th plan. The increase in reliance on imports not only portends a significant increase of 30% to 50% in costs for power plants, it also necessitates expensive technological upgradation as the units are not designed to take more than 10-15% of imported coal at present.

Mini-ratna CCL, a subsidiary of the industry leader Coal India, plans to more than double its coal production to 4 million tons from the present 1.5 mt through underground mining over the next three years. We plan to increase our production to 4 mt per annum from the present 1.5 mt through underground mining by 2013, Central Coalfields Chairman and Managing Director R K Saha told PTI over the phone from Ranchi. The company is slowly increasing its underground mining in a phased manner. It is a challenging job, but CCL is handling very carefully, Saha said. It can be noted that strict environmental laws have put on hold many a coal and power project, apart from the iron ore mines and steel plants. A prominent example is the Rs. 51,000 crore Posco Steel project in Orissa which even after seven years remains on paper as the company has not been able to acquire the land for the project. There are similar other mega projects, from Tata Steel to Vedanta and ArcelorMittal in Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand, which are pending for want of environmental clearances and lands. While the Posco project has a conditional green nod, it is stuck with land acquisition due to stiff opposition from the local population. The previous environment minister Jayaram Ramesh had declared dozens of coal and iron ore mines as no-go areas, which had put the projects in a limbo. CCL recently received clearance from the Environment Ministry for its two open cast coal mines in Magadh and Amrapali. It targets to produce 20 mt per year in Magadh and 12 mt in Amrapali. We have floated tenders for the two new open cast mining projects and are taking steps carefully to achieve the target, he said, adding that company requires railhead closer to the two mines. We have requested the government to complete the Tori-Hazaribag line early. Otherwise, it will be difficult for us to transport the produce, Saha said. When asked how does the company acquire land despite stiff opposition from locals, Saha said, It is a major problem for every company. We always give priority for the welfare of the affected people.

Ive tried to be accurate with the info here but more than happy to be corrected as most info has been taken from news reports, google searches and free broker notes. I wonder what fellow investors think of KPIT Tech (earlier known as KPIT Cummins). I do own a bit and may be looking to buy more hence look forward to learning what fellow investors think. A brief background of the company follows: KPIT is an IT services company that provides varied services and products to multiple industries, primarily in USA and Europe. The market capitalisation of the company is about Rs. 3000 crore with FY14 revenue of ~ Rs 2700 crore, Ebitda of Rs 422 crore and PAT of nearly Rs 240 crore (EPS of Rs 13.42). KPIT generates an ROE of 20%, ROCE of 29% and Ebitda margin of 15.7%. The company has grown its revenue and PAT at a 38% Cagr over the last three years. Also, the management has set itself a revenue target of US$1bn for FY17 (Rs6000 crore, at a 20% Ebitda) which translates into a revenue Cagr of over 30% going forward if the target is to be met. Detailed financials are available at http://www.moneycontrol.com/financials/kpittech/consolidated-profit-loss/KPI02 I am not an IT sector specialist, but it appears to me to not be a run-of-the-mill IT company given that the top management has keen interest in developing the atecha side of the business versus just the business IT side. As per a statement from the CEO in Sept 2013, technology (custom algorithms, own software, development of independent products etc) forms about 33% of the company revenue with the rest being business IT (ERP implementation, portals, website, business applications etc). This mix they want to make 50-50. Also the company doesnat compete in the crowded banking/ insurance space like many other IT cos but concentrates on automotives, manufacturing and energy/ utilities space. Conceptually I like the automotive vertical as intuitively I feel cars and other automotive equipment will have more and more software/ electronics going forward. KPIT is already the largest 3rd party auto electronics vendor in India and so should be a prime beneficiary of this trend. A key irritant for the stock IMHO has been KPITas relentless acquisitions over the last few years that may have perhaps led to dilution, negative free cash flows and integration issues. But I think that KPIT management is recently through with a restructuring exercise and so perhaps one might see execution capabilities and efficiencies increase. Also, I am unsure if acquisitions can continue indefinitely. As per a recent MO report on KPITa http://www.motilaloswal.com/Financial-Services/Research/Detailed-Report/Results-Update-Review/10275/532400 aIts FY15 and FY16 EPS stands at Rs 13.5 and Rs 17.1 respectively. However, I notice that the analyst has factored Ebitda margins of 14.8% and 15.9% for the years, which are virtually at par with 4QFY14 levels. I of course donat claim to understand companies as well as sector specialists, esp IT, but wonder if he/ she has been too conservative in factoring in the managementas restructuring exercise or the profitability of the companies that KPIT has bought since 2003/ 2004. Is there then room for investoras assessment of the companyas fortunes to be jerked upward? KPIT has managed to clock Ebitda margins of 18-20% in the past and this is in-line with their target for FY17 so it isnat completely unreasonable to assume that margins will move closer to 20% in the next two years. But even assuming that the current estimates are correct, KPIT only trades at 8-9x FY16 earnings. It appears to me all the negatives are factored but valuation leaves no room for any positive surprises. Maybe I am wrong, please do share your views on the company! PS: Owning KPIT also offers an option on the success of Revolo which seems to me is an exciting possibility: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolo Thanks!

Looks higher than most of the industry.         ',NULL,'2014-08-19 16:50:33'),(8753,507,1747,'Valid point wrt acquisitions I think. I mention the acquisitions as one of the impediments to investor interest to the stock in my main writeup. But, I am not too worried about the acquisitions as all of them appear to be well focused in the areas that KPIT wants to grow in. My best guess is that the management considered buying expertise/ clients advantageous vs. trying to grow the same organically. E.g. CG Smith was acquired in 2006 for US$6m and that marked KPITs true large scale foray into automotive sector. Today Auto contributes over a fourth of KPIT revenues. Similarly, Sparta was acquired in 2009 for their strong presence in USA in the SAP space. SAP is also about 23% of revenues today, USA. as a whole contributes over 70%. Also, CPG solutions bought in 2010 brings in customer base for Oracle in the USA if Im not mistaken. The latest one is i-Cubedwhich is a Product Life cycle management company appears to be an instance of KPIT trying to increase the intensity of its client mining esp in the manufacturing and auto space. So yes, whilst it would have been best if KPIT had acquired the required expertise and/ or clients on its own, the management has taken the acquisition route. Not completely unreasonable considering that the company wants to take the tech route for its growth. Also, from my limited viewpoint, none of the acquisitions appear to be haphazard in terms of the segments they wish to address. Also, I am perhaps mistaken, but page 125 of KPIT FY14 AR says goodwill is about Rs28 crores not Rs599 crore. Am I looking at the wrong place? (standalone number page 83 is lower at about Rs 8 crore). To address the debtors question, the debtor days are around 80-82. Actually I didnt think that a 3.0 month customer payment cycle was significantly slower than normal. But that is probably because of my ignorance. However, one possible reason could be that nearly 33% of the business is tech based, so payments would be on completion of milestones basis rather than a normal ticketing job associated with routine software maintenance, error testing type of jobs.

Receivables are on the higher side. If you look at industry Infy is @60 days, TCS @82 days, Persistent @64. It looks higher. What is important is to see how the receivables have changed over time because with a lot of acquisitions you tend to acquire a lot of bad debt (looking at previous ARs can give us this info).

Again, this is just a guess on my part. However, the company needs to bridge the enormous gap between reported PAT and the operating cash flow. An IT company that professes its IP and tech edge should not have to depend upon credit period for attracting/ retaining clients like a low tech B&M company, if at all this is happening. Also, if they simply paid the debt using the cash they have OR increased dividend payout it would increase the confidence I have in that cash number being reported.

The H1 profit number and the profit estimates for the remainder of the year, it believes that it will fall short of the annual profit number as guided at the beginning of the year by approximately 10%. It believes there are 3 major reasons for the shortfall in the profit guidance number viz. Hiring of senior level industry experts has been more and faster than the anticipated number at the start of the year, the pace of growth in our non-linear revenues got slightly delayed by a quarter as reflected in the Q1 growth which had a cascading effect and the actual forex gains have been lower than earlier anticipated and in Q1 the growth in both revenue and thus resultant profitability was lower which had a cascading effect for the whole year.It remains positive on growth prospects for second half of the year.It aims to reach the annual revenue of USD 500 Million in FY15.

However, since you bring up  WBs quote, let me respond with what Buffets guru - Graham had to say:   Actually, the typical middle-sized listed company is a large one when compared with the average privately owned business. There is no sound reason why such companies should not continue indefinitely in operation undergoing the vicissitudes characteristic of our economy, but earning on the whole a fair return on their invested capital. This brief review indicates that the stock markets attitude towards secondary companies tends to be unrealistic and consequently to create in normal times innumerable instances of major undervaluation.   The market is fond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordinary vicissitudes into major setbacks. Thus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervaluation: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) Protracted neglect and unpopularity.   The management has been transparent and honest and not earned any negative marks. The business will earn reasonable ROI and its my belief the business is currently undervalued due to currently disappointing results.

I encourage you to use Equitydesks company comparison tool to compare these two companies apples to apples. Persistent had a late IPO, yet is way ahead in terms of valuation, PE premium, productivity metrics, and such stuff. Why? Because KPIT has poorer organic execution.

First of all, I believe this merger is a very good thing from point of view of shareholders. If you remember one of the key worries I had about KPIT were the relentless acquisitions. It almost reminded me of Lynchs di-worse-ification thesis  Now, the company is doing the exact opposite. It is bringing back focus on its strengths. For the purpose of this discussion allow me to call the automotive side of KPIT as its core business and the business IT as the non-core part, Now KPIT is divesting its non core businesses to Birlasoft. Who runs Birlasoft? Anjan Lahiri. Anjan is the founder of mindtree, and if I recall correctly he was instrumental in turning Sasken around as well. As per this report, Sasken lost about 20% of its market cap on the day his departure. From the same article: Lahiri, widely regarded as an ace salesman, started his career with Wipro Infotech in 1987. In 1999, he co-founded Mindtree with other former Wipro executives such as Krishnakumar Natarajan and Ashok Soota. Prior to his departure from Mindtree, he headed the companys IT services business and was instrumental in winning a number of important deals from customers such as AIG, Microsoft and US-based IT firm SITA Now my base case is that, at the very least, the non core of KPIT will become the core of Birlasoft and with a sharp mind like Anjan at the helm, will do much better than the current situation. This benefit will be translated to current shareholders of KPIT as they will get shares in Birlasoft. Secondly, with increased focus on the core business, KPIT will also do much better in the Auto space. I am inherently bullish on the auto software business. As electric vehicles roll on to the road, eventually driverless cars as well perhaps, the software in a car will become a big differentiating factor. It is also not a bodyshopping type of work and anyone can simply google to see the array of patents that KPIT has in this space. An increased focus on the best performing division that is in the sweet spot of a multi year growth industry would bode well for KPIT and will not doubt be reflected in the financials over the next 2-3 years after the demerger.

Revenues down by 10 percent but PAT down by 21 percent YOY. Whole H1 was expected to be a washout though so its all in line. The good news is they have listed loads of new projects including a 60 million dollar one in Germany.

As far as name is concerned it is pretty big in the industry too ( @Nigil I meant Tata elxsi in my post above . My mistake) The difference in valuation is due to elxsis higher margins.

Kudos. I have also been tracking this space closely for last 3-5 years and like you mentioned, It seems the cos with long term mines (which are not coming up for renewal) are big beneficiaries. Due to high premiums, the cost should remain very high for new miners so the old miners seem to have a big cost advantage rather arbitrage going ahead. I also feel GPIL has not got its due ( maybe biased as invested) given the walking the talk done by the management and strong de-leveraging done. Market cap has not increased even equal to the debt reduction done till now over last 3 years. If they can sell/get off from the solar power business or maybe demerge the same, that will be really good.

In 2017 it had a debt of 2200 crores, which has come down to 800 odd crores as of last quarter. From what I remember 375 crore debt belongs to Godavari green, which will also be taken care of with the proposed divestment. Over a period of 5- 6 years the management has given most importance to the deleveraging exercise. They realized early on, that the high leverage is the biggest threat to their business and used every opportunity and good part of their profits to pare down debt. This deleveraging didnt start with the current commodity bull run that ensued after covid crisis, it started back in 17-18 when there was a small upcycle. With the debt gone, company will be out of debt restructuring and we may see the pledged shares getting released( 32.5%). If the company is able to get the environmental clearance for increasing the mining capacity that will be a tremendous boost to the profits of the company. The company was quite confident of getting the EC soon in the last concall. The company has announced a dividend of Rs.5 per share in the last quarter.  With debt almost retired, the company can come up with a dividend distribution policy giving more return to the shareholders.

GPIL was perceived to be a conglomerate because of this solar power plant (unrelated diversification - a management error); hence GPIL always traded cheaper. Legendary Fund Manager, Mr. Bharat Shah has stated - a conglomerate will most likely be valued at a multiple of its weak business as markets get confused when there are different business segments. But now there is a scope of re-rating. Management is rational and will undertake capex only with internal accruals (estimated free cash flows Rs600-800 cr per year based on normal steel cyclecurrently Rs1200 cr per year due to strong uptrend in steel) So i believe it should trade at an EV/EBITDA of 4-6 x of its Rs1000 cr estimated normalized EBITDA (current EBITDA run-rate is Rs2000cr per year). Now few sequence of events to follow would be:  Iron ore mining expansion (200 cr mining EBITDA additional will be generated) Expansion of billets, sponge (brownfield) Company becomes debt free and releases pledge (likely in Q1FY22) Next phase of greenfiled project/ acquisition of distressed assets  Also, now iron ore availability has improved a lot in Ardent due to the sourcing skills of the new partner.

References Energy  My valuation for GGEL: GGEL has earned revenue of Rs.88.66 Crores and net profit of Rs.14.28 Crores for the nine months ended on 31st December, 2020. If we extrapolate it for 12 months revenue comes at around 118.23 Cr. Average revenue had been around 90 to 100 Cr.

The PPA with NTPC is for 25 years w.e.f 17/06/2013 i.e around 8 years gave already elapsed and remaining PPA period is around 17 years.

The Company in their recent concals had advised that gradually they are shifting to high grade pellets and the CAPEX requirement for the same is almost Nil and which has also been done by the Company. The Company had also recently received approvals for expansion of its  Iron Ore benefaction plant from 1MTPA to 3.28 MTPA which will be utilised by it for producing high grade pellets. Why China is preferring high grade pellet?? There are two main reason for this:   High grade pellet in Blast furnace requires lesser amount of Coal for steel production. Lesser amount of burning Coal in Blast Furnace results in less coal energy consumption(and obviously lesser coal consumption) which leads to lesser pollution. reducing pollution has become a thing of paramount importance in China. You can produce steel in China if the process is less polluting so their survival is now dependent on low polluting feed to Blast furnace. This also results in reducing their Energy/Coal expense.   When you are operating at full capacity utilization , high grade pellet increases your output because blast furnace has a fixed capacity and if amount of Coal to be fed is decreased then you can charge/input extra pellet in Blast furnace which will led to higher output for a given capacity i.e with a given capacity your steel out put will be higher if you charge pellet instead of Coal. When you are making high margins in your product you would always prefer to operate at full capacity that to with maximum output.   The above are  two main reasons which are driving   demand for high grade pellet. Further due to lower coal handling and high grade pellet, the duration of cycle of steel production is also reduced in Blast furnace for example if your steel cycle in Blast furnace with  low grade Iron ore is X hrs then because of high grade pellet it will come down by 3 to 4 % because of which the efficiency of Blast furnace will increase by 3 to 4 %.

International Market   Iron ore prices have climbed to US$ 233/t, touching multi-year high, and is now trading at US$ 200/t. Among the 3 major iron ore producers globally only Vale has been projecting higher production in FY22. The demand supply is expected to remain tight for next 1-2years.   Pellet prices have been tracking higher iron ore prices and have remained strong at US$241/t CIF China, down from recent peak of US$268/t. China is focused on decarbonisation of the economy and this has increased demand for higher grade pellets and iron ore.     Domestic market   Indian iron ore prices have almost doubled in last 3 months to 9300/t for 62% Fe (Orissa iron ore fines).   Indian iron ore production declined by 44mnt in FY21 and at the same time cost curve got bumped up as the winning bid premium on recently held auction in Odisha has been between 90%-150% of IBM iron ore prices.   Pellet prices in India have hit 10 year high. Domestic Pellet demand & prices are on rise due to shortage of iron ore. Current pellet prices are trading close to 15,000+ per tonne for 64%/63% Fe.

Does Godawari compete with other integrated players for pellets in domestic market? If yes, how does it stand vs them once domestic demand recovers? Major question post deleveraging would be around capital allocation. You mentioned somewhere that GPIL is looking to add additional flat steelmaking capacity at much cheaper CAPEX/t vs greenfield.

Basically quantity is so small their is little customer risk. To reduce carbon footprint, the only way is higher grade iron ore and pellets. Coke consumption goes down. The market is very large as we discussed in point 1. No competition, but Godawari has the best quality pellet 65-66% Fe content and low alumina. It commands a premium of US$10-20/t over other sellers from India. The announced plans for capex are Rs750cr for captive solar power plant of 250MW to be completed in next 2yrs.  In addition they have announced MOU for sponge iron and steel making worth Rs4000cr or so. But these MOUs have no time frame and will depend on land acquisition and environment clearances, so no capex is envisaged over next 2years atleast.

Industry outlook  Currently, Demand from Paint industry is almost Rs 1000-1100crs of which 50% demand is from Asian Paints in organized sector while Lube Oil demand is in the range of Rs 400-500cr. Apart from organized market, Unorganised market demand is in the range of Rs 350-400crs. Recently, Edible Oil mfgs is also started using rigid packaging in which company is into. Based on initial estimates, the size would be around Rs 1000cr of which company intends to capture 10% share in coming 15-18 months.  In Mould Labeling (IML) Decorated containers  Company offers IML containers and is only company in India with its own in-house process. Company has filed the process patent to Indian Patent Office which has been accepted there, certificate to come in next 2yrs. Currently, most of its existing clients are shifting to IML containers. Asian Paints which is their biggest client is apprehensive as it will make them dependent on the company for the container supply and is not keen to fully shift to IML as of now. Company reported IML sales of Rs 95cr (33% of total revenue) vs Rs 61cr yoy.   QIP Issue  Company recently raised Rs 55cr at price of Rs 220/sh by issuing 25 lakh shares. DSP Blackrock MF, SBI MF, Principal MF, Amundi Funds and Canara Robeco MF are among the investors subscribed to the QIP issue. No plans for raising any equity for next 12-18 months.  Guidance  Companys growth is primarily driven by Lubricants, Paints and Edible Oil companies, of which, Lubes and Paints industry are currently facing some headwinds while companys recent entry into edible oil segment is showing significant traction. Company is expanding its edible oil molding capacity by 8000tpa which will get operational in phased manner over FY16. Full benefit to accrue in FY17. Company expect volume growth for FY16e at 10% and FY17e at 20%. Realization are linked with input prices so assuming the current RM prices, management see slight improvement in Ebitda margin to 15% vs 14.25% reported in Fy15.  Capacity  Company has current capacity of 22500tpa and is planning to expand it to 32500tpa by next year end. Current utilization is at 70%. Management indicated that the segment is such that it cannot operate at the nameplate capacity.  Capex  Company is currently expending its Edible oil molding capacity by 8000tpa at three locations with combined capex of Rs 45cr of which company already have spent Rs 14cr during the year. Company also plans to setup its first overseas plant at RAK (Saudi Arabia) with capacity of 3000tpa at total outlay of Rs 10-12cr. Company has deferred its two plants  Vizag (for Asian Paints) and Gwalior (for Akzo Nobel)  due to deferment by the clients by a year or two. Company dont intent to invest any money this fiscal there.   Debt  As of Mar15, total debt stands at Rs 15cr (Rs 10cr LT debt). Networth at Rs 116cr.

However, the rights will be with the company till likely patent awarding Response from square containers has beaten expectations set during QIP 5 litre mould has huge potential IML is highly resource efficient as most of the man power work is taken up by robots Pricing: Oil/lube is dependent on raw material. However, IML FMCG (oil) is mostly independent as there is no competition at the prices Mold Tek offer Capex: Total 60 Cr - 15 Cr Hyd, Sharjah - 10-17 Cr, Approx 15 Cr for Gwalior and Vizak Satara and Daman are existing plants Sharjah (RAK) and Hyd current year; Gwalior and Vizak next year Sharjah will be ready for commercial production by Mar-Apr 2016 Capacity and addition: Current capacity: 22k tonn, Addition: 10k 65% utilization.

Next year IML will be around 40-45% Growth: Fy16 will be 10-15% topline growth. However, Fy17 will be a great year (25%) as Sharjah, Gwalior and probably Vizak capacity will come on stream Doubling tonnage in the next 3 years. If raw material is 100 Rs, they can do 600 Cr from th current 300 Cr in the next 3 years EBIDTA to grow by 100 bps next year Debt: Majority of it is working capital Post Capex, it will come back to the existing levels.

They initially ignored this after first few years to concentrate on the Technology business and now that has taken the 2nd seat Although they have been able to ramp up capacity in last few years and have been talking about the IML being their differentiated technology, there is hardly any pricing power being a B2B business.

Listened to the Q4 earnings call today and the guidance for FY 16 is 10-12% revenue growth, Q1 may be even worse. As you all have covered FY17 is where the real game starts. Recently, I have also been reading a lot from Ian Cassels blog (hes a micro cap, <= 2000 cr / $300 m, investor in the US) and trying to imbibe some of his investing approaches apart from talking to the management (which Im not ready for yet but is very important for investing in microcaps). So Im trying to look at this from a long/ultra long term approach (5-15) years. Does it have the potential to be a 5-10x? As it is, Im not going to get all in in one scoop but average up as the performance keeps unraveling. My concerns as per the management call :-  Paints sector not growing more than 7-8% Overall lubes sector growth is negative 2-3% as management pointed out oils are becoming better in terms of mileage dilevered Q1-Q2 FY 16 - how weak will it be? Even though raw materials prices have firmed up but theyve only reached last years levels. Management guidance didnt seem positive at all for FY16. As Ian Cassel says, the best managements under promise and over deliver. May be you guys can guide me how to take the guidance here.  Valuation seems fair/undervalued compared to peers.

I have been thinking on similar lines for last few months. So here is my take. Concern 1. Slowdown in paint industry is a temporary phenomena and should pick up once economy picks up.actually Asian paints deferment of their proposed plant could have been a major cause of concern but the demand for edible oil containers should make up for it Concern 2  According to me Lube industry will continue to degrow so nothing can be done about it Concern 3 See for a b2b company you can not see directly at sales growth figures as they move with crude price. Even though the capacity/output had grown at a much higher rate this year there was hardly any growth in revenue but margins expanded and that is the thing to keep tracking. Regarding waiting for while to enter my observation is that the markets always discount the news much faster than people expect. This in no way means you should take the entry now. For me the biggest thing to look out for is how they create/strengthen new product categories like square edible oil containers and whether they are able to maintain/improve on their margins by pushing their so called moat (IML technology). Biggest risk for microcaps like this is the market volatility as even 1 average result can led to further derating and this can go down further with low volumes as it has done from 260 odd levels         ',NULL,'2015-06-23 00:12:49'),(9148,509,1840,'Hey buddy, The revenue isnt growing because its linked with raw material cost.

Company offers both Screen Print Container (60%) and In-Mould Labelling (IML) Containers (40%) using Injection moulding technology. Injection moulding machines are supplied by Toshiba and Cincinatti and costs around Rs 50 lakhs. Company has in-house mould making and Robotics (for IML) which reduces costs by Rs 50lakhs.   Industry outlook  Currently, Demand from Paint industry is almost Rs 1000-1100crs of which 50% demand is from Asian Paints in organized sector while Lube Oil demand is in the range of Rs 400-500cr. Apart from organized market, Unorganised market demand is in the range of Rs 350-400crs. Recently, Edible Oil mfgs is also started using rigid packaging in which company is into. Based on initial estimates, the size would be around Rs 1000cr of which company intends to capture 10% share in coming 15-18 months.  In Mould Labeling (IML) Decorated containers  Company offers IML containers and is only company in India with its own in-house process. Company has filed the process patent to Indian Patent Office which has been accepted there, certificate to come in next 2yrs. Currently, most of its existing clients are shifting to IML containers. Asian Paints which is their biggest client is apprehensive as it will make them dependent on the company for the container supply and is not keen to fully shift to IML as of now. Currently, IML sales contributes 40% of sales in Q1 vs 28% last year qtr. Company targets IML sales to increase further to 60% this fiscal and to over 75% next fiscal. IML carries higher margin of 18% vs Screen Printing margin of 13% as it is more decorative and less rejection.  RM benefit is pass through: Supply agreement with the clients is such that any RM cost is a pass through in nature. This is the reason in Q1 Sales degrew -1% yoy while Company reported 7% volume growth while realization declined by 8% as RM Index for the company came down to 100 vs 107.81 in Q1 last year. Company is seeing this trend further coming down to 94-95 in Q2 which will be passed on. However, the cost is pass through, low RM cost helps company to compete with other packaging materials like aluminium, tin and glass packaging.   Adding 40% capacity this year: Current capacity stands at 22500 tpa which will increase to 32000 tpa by adding 8000tpa of edible moulding plants at Satara and Daman and 3000tpa plant they are setting up in RAK, Dubai. Total capex planned this year will be around Rs 40cr. For FY17, company will look into expansion for Asian Paints and Akzo Nobel plants depending on their plant commissioning timeline. Management also looking to add more capacities at RAK depending on demand and conversion to IML. Overall, they are looking at 40-50% capacity addition every year for next 2-3 years. Sustainable utilization levels will be 75%  QIP Issue  Company recently raised Rs 55cr at price of Rs 220/sh by issuing 25 lakh shares. DSP Blackrock MF, SBI MF, Principal MF, Amundi Funds and Canara Robeco MF are among the investors subscribed to the QIP issue. No plans for raising any equity for next 12-18 months.  Guidance  Companys growth is primarily driven by Lubricants, Paints and Edible Oil companies, of which, Lubes and Paints industry are currently facing some headwinds while companys recent entry into edible oil segment is showing significant traction. Company is expanding its edible oil molding capacity by 8000tpa which will get operational in phased manner over FY16. Full benefit to accrue in FY17. Company expect volume growth for FY16e at 10-12% and Realization are linked with input prices so assuming the current RM prices, they expect revenue growth will be muted at 4-5% but margin will improve as penetration as well as utilization levels improve.

It can keep on churning 20-25% volume growth as IML has widened the scope of industries the co. can cater. But I wish to understand what kind of RoE can the co. make for its owners. I want to focus on competition,my understanding by far has been that after competition catches up with IML technology and achieves similar production efficiency like Mold-tek today,Mold-tek has no advantage over its competition except for in-house capability to build robots and moulds which only translates to lower capital expenditure on machinery or in other words higher asset turns or higher RoE for similar quantity manufactured by a competitor. Mold-Tek has first mover advantage for IML but after a period of time its going to get commoditised and as it happens in a commoditised industry,2-3 players with best efficiency,quality,consistency and on-time delivery will fight it out in offering lowest cost to customers. This will ensure RoEs to hover somewhere above CoC. Mold-Tek can pass on its efficiency derived out of higher asset turns,offer products cheaper relative to competitors,have a high market share (B2B nature of business will ensure there are 2-3 prominent players,no single will corner market share) and still maintain RoE similar or slightly higher to competitors. Another concern is rm prices,it has the ability to shrink revenue statement and  affect RoE by suppressing asset turns. Mold Tek also churns lower absolute profits for re-investment which Im sure it has lot to do in future. Margins remaining intact is a saving grace. On the other hand in some years rm prices could bloat the revenue statement and earn higher absolute profits (So,this investment will also require one to take call on direction of crude). Does someone has a clue whether there is a complete pass on if rm prices fall below a certain threshold,meaning will the pass on affect asset turns in such a manner that RoE will fall below CoC? At best,Mold-tek can be looked at as a co. that earns average RoC and can re-deploy capital to earn average RoC. My complete understanding is based on the premise of IML tech turning into a commodity in future,1-2 years. Please share contradicting insights on completion,if any. Views invited. P.S. Edibile Oil containers is a 1000cr mkt. and the co. is banking big time on it migrating from blow-moulded to injection-moulded with IML. The co. designed square containers especially for edible oil industry are seeking patent protection for the same. This exclusivity could help it earn higher returns but its also preposterous to think entire opportunity will be eaten away by one co.

Hence during times of lower raw material prices, operating margins would look to be slightly higher and vice versa during times of higher raw material prices. This would compensate for lower asset turns in low raw material price situation and vice versa. Hence RoE would remain constant, provided volume of products is same, implying constant absolute profits. In fact during times of lower raw material prices, the pass on is not fully in proportion, and some marginal profit is retained by company. Hence my take on ROE is it would not get impacted by change in raw material prices. Increase in volume would be primarily the main factor. Regarding competition, company ahead of its peers by 2-3 years in terms of adapting to the changes in product mix/trends and delivering superior quality in lower costs on basis of its lower capex. Even after 2-3 years the low cost with quality product advantage would still exist, as capex is substantially lower compared to other players.

Capacity shifted from RAK has been mainly allocated to these packs and other food packing products. RAK Subsidiary: Mr. J.

The company expects to exit FY20 with the capacity utilization of 50% at these two plants. Polypropylene prices are not falling but they are stable in the range of +/- 5%. The company is able to pass on RM price changes, both positive & negative.  Competition  Competition - Hi-Tech Packaging, Time Technoplast, Jolly, Manjushree. Time Technoplast products cover 50-100-200L size packs. Manjushree derives 60-70% of its revenue from PET bottles which government has banned. Competitive advantage against smaller players in food industry - Hygeine is the most important factor which we can guarantee, we can work with large volumes & deal with seasonality (e.g. 4x more demand for ice cream products in summer vs. winter), we use our own labels which helps us to control costs.  Paints  Berger paints is our customer for 28-29 years now & they would like us to setup a plant in UP to support their upcoming plant there. The company supplies ~25-35% of the requirements of the paint players, rest are supplied by players linked with promoters or some other players mentioned above. Most of the other players (for paint industry) use Heat Transfer Label (HTL) as a mode of decoration due to lower cost compared to IML. HTL uses 18 micron PET film. if government bans 50 micron film, there might be some impact. The price difference between HTL & IML is 3-4 rs. Concentration Risk with Asian Paints contributing 30% of the sales - AP is very ethically managed company and we have 30 years of relationship with them.  Food & FMCG  The Food & FMCG segment might grow at 40% in FY20. The growth in Q1 was 70%. We might exit the year for F&F segment at 130cr. Edible Oil segment will be big driver of growth in F&F. The company has introduced 15L pack in this segment recently.The company is also working with several clients like - Nestle, GSK, Dabur, ITC, Britannia, Emami etc. Iron container vs. IML container in edible oil segment - The price of IML is high compared to tin container. There is potential for food contamination/tampering in tin container & there might be a ban on re-sue of tin container. IML container is tamper proof. The product margins in edible oil are better than the paints. The company has received a big order from Britannia for 10L pack. The company is also working on a product for cheese.  Learning from RAK Plant  The company expected Iranian market to open up & big demand from oil/paints/lube companies. But due to various geopolitical reasons, it never happened. Further one of the customer Akzo Nobel had promised larger volumes in those markets but it did not materialize. The company had procured bigger machines for RAK plant & those have been moved back to India. They are getting well used in edible oil segment for creating 10/15/20L packs. The equipment was imported from Japan & there is some impact due to yen appreciation. The customers will be served from India & the company will be cautious in overseas expansion going forward.  Plastic Ban  The plastic ban is on - single use plastics, PET bottle of smaller size & thin plastic which is < 250 microns. The trouble with these plastics is they are very hard to collect & reuse. Vaccume or thermo formed plastics are more at the risk of getting banned vs. injection molded plastics which are much thicker & easier to collect/recycle.

So as of now I do not see there will be any problem or rather there will be shift of some of the very thin wall products of like say thermoformed or vacuum formed containers they have no option but to shift to injection moulding and come for our IML injection moulding containers. So, any ban of thin wall will rather benefit our company than affecting growth. *sippers with Pepsi are moving again they were reluctant to take a call till the ban clarity comes. Now we are again in talks with them. Hopefully next quarter they may take a call. It went very close to start off but again when the talk of plastic ban came they wanted to wait and see what would be the outcome. Now again they were getting in touch with them and hopefully in couple of quarters they might come out with their decision *Asian Paints contribution is around 37 to 38% while Nerolac (12%) and castrol takes No. 2 and No. 3 position resp[. Mondelez contribution has come dn by 20 to 25% and the present contribution is around 8 to 9% Shifting of Hosur plant will result in  the saving Rs 1 Cr PA. *M2K that is Cadbury there is a drop in their overall sales which has affected our numbers because somehow the brand is yet to take off but it is still considerable, they are around Rs.25 Crores to Rs.30 Crores turnover we will be able to get from them which was around 36 last year so there is a drop of 15% to 18% in the full year but still the numbers were decent enough. In the case of HUL there is no drop actually HUL numbers have increased and in this year from few Crores a couple of Crores last year, we are doing more than Rs.10, 12 Crores this year and with the new product that is being added probably next year we will be doing around Rs.18 to 20 Crores per annum and another big addition of brand is Hatsun, Hatsun is Arun brand of ice creams, after ice creams they are into dairy products like curds and yogurts that is really picking up. Hatsun numbers are going to be very considerable in the next financial year this year it was around Rs.5 to 6 Crores last year that is the year ending March, but this year we are anticipating anywhere around Rs.12 to 15 Crores turnover coming from them. Hatsun and HUL will be to growth stars in the next season and we are also in touch with Nestle, Dabur and ITC foods.

Management expects a better Q4. The company plans to add to existing capacities in a staggered manner over the next 4-5 years, which would support volume growth in the long term. Food segment has been flat YoY, but the company has added a number of new clients and entered into new industrial segments which could further add to volumes. Management expects F&F sales to grow 35-40% for FY20, and become 2.5x in the next 3-4 years. Lubes has been a dampener, which can be attributed to the auto segment slowdown. Overall, the management seems confident about 20% growth over the medium term aided by systematic capex and expansion into high margin F&F categories. Mr. Rao is very open with his answers and positive about the overall business. The stock has been consolidating for a while now, and any positive surprises in Q4 should help with a re-rating. The removal of entire share pledging by April 2020 is an evidence of the promoters vision to work towards the benefit of shareholders.

Business overview:  ~35 year old Company, makes injection molded plastic containers (rigid packaging) with in-mold labelling (IML) technology. IML is the process by which labels and parts are created in the same step. Also has other printing techniques such as heat transfer labelling and off-set printing that are done as an extra step after molding of part is completed Three main customers segments: a.	Paints: Enjoys good wallet share with Top 4 (Asian Paints, Berger, Akzo and Kansai) b.	Lubricants: Customers include Castrol, Exxon, Shell, BP etc. c.	Food and FMCG packaging: Ice-cream makers, edible oil maker, dairy products makers, some customers - ITC, HUL, Cadbury, Amul etc. Brief financials (which justify worth looking into further): a.	5 year revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGR range: 12-15% b.	Consistent EBITDA margins in the high teens c.	Mcap  INR 800 cr, revenue  INR 400 cr, EBITDA  70 cr, pat  30 cr, debt  working capital 80cr, term debt  25 cr d.	ICRA A- rated Key Promoters: Well educated owners who seem to have been running tight ship on operations. Also second generation also into business a.	J Lakshman Rao (JLR) (MD) (Main promoter who looks at marketing and finance and who usually frequents investor calls) b.	Subramanyam (DMD) (Looks at mold design / production / manufacturing) 7 plants across India. UAE plant shut-down after Company ran it sub-optimally for ~3 years (did not get enough orders from clients as envisaged earlier) (injection machines have been relocated to India and been put to use for making edible oil packs instead. Company has taken a write-off of ~12 cr, initial investment was ~50 cr)  Value chain:  Key raw material: Polypropylene (main supplier is Reliance Industries), labels & other consumables (form the balance RMs) MTP operations are integrated for injection molding and label making. Sales is direct to customers. The robots and tooling required for IML process are made in-house  Business:  Promoter and management quality: Feedback from concalls is that Promoter is generally on top of business numbers and also of emerging trends. JLR seems to be the key man driving business and bringing in new clients Business key investment themes: a.	Largest IML rigid packaging company with capabilities of in-house mold design, robot making and labelling  Helps in efficiently managing production & supply of different SKUs, cost of operations lower (compared to importing robots, outsourcing labelling) b.	Blue-chip customer relationship established over several years (Asian Paints contributes 30-35% of revenue and is core customer) c.	Attractive industry growth prospects i.	Consumer play that can mimic growth of underlying paints, food and FMCG industries ii.	Premiumisation in packaging leading to conversion to IML packs (% of food & FMCG business has increased for the Company from 5% 7-8 years back to ~20% now). This will also be margin accretive as food & FMCG packs are sold at higher realisation Key risks: Is this a growth trap?  Can Company keep growing at 15% topline? Lube growth may bring down overall growth of ~10-12% growth of paints + Food/fmcg a.	Growth may be supported by conversion into IML packs from paints and food & fmcg clients. Currently food & FMCG contribution is 20%, another 20% increase can take EBITDA margin up by ~2%). Need to assess ease of switching by speaking with fmcg players. How big can IML get  In one of the concalls, it was mentioned that paints is a 2000-2500 cr market, lubes is another 1000 cr market, food + fmcg could be 20000 cr Client concentration: Top 5 contribute 60-70%. Need to diversify volumes to more customers. a.	May be difficult for AP to shift out volumes to competitor, but gradual shift-out to Hitech others may be possible but would categorise as low threat Technology: Need to assess how advantageous is IML over other packaging/labelling techniques. Also Company claims to be the only player to have figured out how to make IML packs successfully at scale to its clients. Need to dig deeper as to why it is so difficult to replicate Can company sustain EBITDA margins: Margins seem to be consistent historically. Company claims to having monthly reset clauses based on a certain RM price fluctuation Regulatory ban on plastics: Currently not affected. Crackdown on single use plastics/thermocol not related to Company. Any future ban on multi-layer plastics of higher microns will have to be seen.

Any product has a life cycle it takes a couple of years to penetrate and come into a sizeable business quantum - sweet boxes maybe 4-5 Cr this year they can become 15-25 Cr in the next FY. Hyderabad plant has been upgraded to cater to the increase in demand for F&F (inaugurated in June 2021) Have acquired 2.7 acres of land at Sandila Industrial Area in UP, just next to Berger Paints upcoming plant. The plant will get constructed in year 22-23, and will go to production simultaneously when Berger is ready to go with their new plant (this new plant will focus on Berger, Nerolac, and edible oils) (Total Capex around 20 crores) Installed capacity is 42,000 MTPA, from 34,000 from the beginning of FY21 (20% growth). Going forward this year, it will grow to 45/46000 MTPA because of Kanpur leased facility. Out of the 42,000 installed capacity around 32,000 is in use actively i.e. 75% capacity utilization.

Volume as of July: 1-1.5 million/month, by Q3 FY22, will go up to 2-2.5 million/month and by Q4 FY22 will go up to 3 million/month (which is 50% capacity utilization, max capacity is 6-7 million/month as of now) In the FY23, the capacity utilization for pumps will go up to 70-75%, which is similar to other products.

Lubricants are the segments that are most dying for this product because they face a lot of duplication and counterfeit issues. One QR code is present inside (reverse coded QR code) the product container also and that can be scanned only once, and this gives an anti-counterfeit feature. Promotion can also be done via QR-coded IML containers, because a single scan can take customers to the website, and companies can give schemes to customers. Some developed countries also have this technology, but they use it more for promotion strategies than anti-counterfeit, as it is not a big issue there. But in India, we have a bigger issue of counterfeiting. The applications are many, just have to see for a few years how this gets evolved.

Election led spending contributed just 2% of the revenues during Q3. The election led spending from general election will be seen in Q1 FY15.

However, challenges in the economy continue and it will be very difficult now for the company to increase prices, at least in H1 FY\'16.      Management expects relatively lower growth in H1 FY\'16 while H2 FY\'16 will be relatively better in terms of both volume and prices.      Phase 3 now is clearly divided into 2 parts. In first part, about 135 frequencies covering the peak cities will come to auction somewhere in June 2015. The process is delayed by couple of months. Management expects smooth migration of existing frequencies to Phase 3. Further, the actual and full fetch operationalization of these new frequencies will be from Q4 FY\'16 onwards.      The Government has rejected the acquisition offer of the company of the Radio business of TV Today company. As per the Government, this is not within the framework of the policies. The company has challenged the decision and has gone to Delhi High court and the matter is pending.      Current Blended utilization for the company stands at 107% for top 8 radio stations which are operating for 17 hours per day. At peak levels, the company can increase the utilization to 135% as well.      Overall, management expects the Radio industry should grow around 10-12% in FY\'16.      As on Mar\'15, company has free cash flow of around Rs 556 crore.  Disc: Not Invested. But on watchlist.

Company  is a leading FM radio broadcaster in the country with 32 operating stations spread across India with total listenership of more than 37 million. It operates the FM radio network with Radio Mirchi brand. 	ENIL is one of the oldest players in radio broadcasting business with its first station becoming operational as early as year 2000. It also has the distinction of being the only radio broadcasters to have consistently reported operating and net profit for last many years while all other players struggled to stay afloat. 	 ENIL is an undisputable market leader with 33-35% revenue market share in spite of some of its peers having much larger foot print and operations in terms of number of stations. According to the last IRS radio listenership survey done Q4 2012, Radio Mirchi is way ahead of its competitors with weekly listenership base of 37.5 million, 50% more than the listenership of its nearest competitor. 	ENIL aspires to be a complete solution provider for the advertisers through multiple touch-points across various media. ENIL is slowly and steadily scaling up its non-radio businesses such as digital, activation and TV properties. Industry: Opportunity Size & Future Growth 	As compared to other media segments, FM radio industry in India is still in its early years. Private FM radio industry started its journey from 2001 with award of frequency to private broadcasters under Phase-I licensing. Thus, the FM radio industry is barely 14 years old in the country while other media like print and TV have been in existence since many years. 	Indian FM radio industry has grown at significantly higher rate as compared to other media as is evident from the below table. Value in Rs. Crore   Radio broadcasting market has grown at 18% CAGR  from 2001 to 2013 increasing the share of radio broadcasting market in overall advertising spend  from 2.5% to 4%.  The only media segment that has performed the radio is digital advertising. Key Drivers of Radio Industrys Future Growth  Even though,  radio industry has grown at brisk rate, it is likely that the industry is likely to grow at brisk rate due to the confluence of following 4 factors     Based on following range of possibilities on key assumptions Indias   GDP in nominal terms in 2014 is USD 2 trillion   In next 5 years, Indian  GDP  growing in the range of 6-8%;   Advertising spending accounting for 0.5%-0.7% the total GDP   Radio garnering 5% -7% share in the overall advertising spending   The size of the Indian radio industry may reach anywhere between  INR 4000 Crore to 6000 Crore in 2019  in next 5-8 years implying 20-25% CAGR.  Even though, none of the above numbers are sacrosanct, it is reasonably safe to infer that size of the Indian radio industry is going to grow significantly higher than its current size in next 5 years with growth for next five years at least equalling the historical growth rate of radio industry in last 5 years (18% CAGR)  Competitive Landscape 	In all there are 19 players in FM radio space other than All India radio. However, in terms of countrywide presence, there are only  4 major players which have pan-India presence, well spread out network and geographical & social reach  Thus, two aspects are clear from the above analysis o	Pan India FM radio broadcasting market is an oligopoly with 4 large players o	ENIL enjoys the dominant position in the industry with market share of 33-35% which is 50% more than that of its nearest competitor Salient characteristics of the business model: 	Companys pre-dominant revenue stream comes from Advertisement. Total ad-revenue is a function of 1)  number of operational channels 2)  advertising rates 3)  number of ad slots in an hour and 4)  Number of operating hours in a day. Out of the four variables, two variables i.e. number of ad slots in an hours (typical range is from 13-18 minutes) and number of operating hours in a day (in the range from 16-20 hrs)  have physical cap. Thus, once company reaches an optimal number on both these variables at existing stations, the incremental growth shall be driven by the other two variables  Only 7-8% of the ENILs cost is strictly variable cost while the rest is fixed cost. Hence there is huge operating leverage present in the business. Thus, after the operations reach break even point, large portion of incremental revenue will flow to the bottom line.  Company, in a steady state operation, shall be able to achieve EBIDTA in the range of 32-36%  Company, from time to time, would need to pay large one-time fee for getting the new license/renewal of license for FM bandwidth that it intends to use. This onetime payment is then amortized as cost over the period of license period. This peculiarity will require company to slowly accumulate and maintain decent amount of cash on the books for renewal of existing license or acquisition of new license. The above trait also implies that since company would have paid the onetime fee upfront, the amortization of the license fee is a non-cash expense. Thus, in most of the years, the cash flow may be much higher than the reported profit. Financial Analysis:   In last 5 years, companys top line has grown at 14% CAGR from 231 Crores in 2009-10 to 438 Crores in 2014-15.  In year 2004-05, company had top line of 75 Crores. Thus, over last 10 years, companys top line has grown at CAGR of 18%.   Companys net profit has grown 37.5% CAGR in last 5 years from 17.9 Crores in 2009-10 to 105.98 crores in 2013-14. Over last 10 years, ENILs net profit has grown CAGR 25%.   Company has maintained a very healthy balance sheet throughout last 5 years. Company had marginal leverage in 2009-10, however since 2010-11, company has zero debt. In last 10 years, in only 4 years, company had debt on its balance sheet   Company has consistently increased its investment (mostly parked in liquid mutual funds) from 40 Crores in 2009-10 to 549 Crores in 2014-15. This clearly suggests that there is significant free cash flow in the business. Company has been parking the cash in liquid investment, quite aligned with the peculiar business requirement of making large one-time payment for renewal of license and acquiring new licenses.   Working capital management reflects effectiveness of the management in running the operations. ENILs working capital requirement has consistently declined from 48% of revenue in 2009-10 to 14% of revenue in 2013-14.   Key Ratio Analysis    It is important to recognize that for ENIL, ROIC is a much better measure return profile of the business and not ROE or ROCE. The primary reason lies in the inherent business model where Company retains and accumulates cash generated from it to be utilized for acquiring more frequencies in the next round of auction. Thus, ROE and ROCE during this capital accumulation phase, will look artificially subdued. However, ROIC, over a long duration will give a more realistic view of the business.   However, it is important to recognize that, from time to time, as company deploys additional cash for acquiring new frequencies and renewing existing frequencies, the return ratio will dip for the time being (as the money spent will increased the fixed asset-e.g. period from 2007-10) till the depreciation will reduce the gross block and income will start flowing from new stations. I believe that looking at the business model of ENIL (and other radio companies), IRR is the right matrix to evaluate the companys capital deployment efficiency   Key Growth Drivers Phase-III Auction: Currently, there are 245 operating FM channels present across 88 cities spread through the country. At present, FM channels are mainly present in larger cities with very limited presence in smaller towns. Since 2005-06, there has been no new channel awarded and hence, the volume growth and reach of the industry has stagnated. Under Phase-III, GoI is planning to issue FM channel license in additional 227 cities and total number of channels is going to increase to 839, which is more than 200% increase from current level.  Higher number of channels will improve the inventory for the ENIL and thus aid volume growth. On the other hand, increased reach will lead to higher realization for the company as national advertisers will be able to pay more for addressing the larger audience base. Thus, Phase-III expansion, in medium term will drive both volume and value growth. In the first batch of phase-III auction, ENIL has won frequencies in to 7 new cities and 10 new frequencies in existing market. This combined with its acquisition of TV Todays radio business, it has acquired 4 frequencies in new markets and may acquire 3 additional frequencies in Delhi/Mumbai/Kolkata if the MIB approves the transfer of frequency. In all, its number of channels have increased from 33 to 52 and may go to 55 if the Delhi/Mumbai/Kolkata frequency transfer is approved by MIB. Improved Realization: Even though ENIL enjoys significant lead in terms of listenership over its peers in number of cities that it operates in, it has not increased the advertising rates for last many years due to sluggish economy, idling inventory and lack of awareness about radios attractiveness as advertising medium. Typically, for a 10 second slot across network, the realization for ENIL is 10,000 while the same is 100,000 for  a TV chanel (General Enterntainment). Thus, there exist a vast difference in advertising rates, which even if adjusted for the lack of visual impact (present in TV advertisement), may provide good room for radio players to increase the pricing. Now, as the sentiments are improving in the economy with revival is in sight and inventory levels getting utilized more than 100%, company has initiated the price hike from December 2014 across most of its markets. Thus, this will be another kicker for growth in medium to long term.  In the Q2, FY 16, management indicated that the pricing has increased by 7.5% YOY and management intends to continue focus on increasing pricing. Activation & Event Business: In addition to the radio business, ENIL has also successfully experimented and scaled up non-radio business which caters to events and activation by leveraging the brand and reach of the radio business. We believe that this business is still taking baby steps, however with increasing reach of the network, ENILs creative and marketing teams ability to create value proposition for advertisers and demonstrated track record of activation/events to generate decent return for advertisers, in the long run, this can provide fillip to the overall growth of the company Monetizing Digital Presence & Other Opportunities: ENIL was the early adopter in radio industry in going digital. It has launched highest number of channels (currently stands at 13) in association with gaana.com. Management has indicated that they have started monetizing this digital properties and though the current contribution from digital is miniscule it is likely to go up significantly. ENIL is also looking at other innovative opportunities like running airport radio at the large terminals. It recently entered into agreement with Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) to start providing airport radio services at T3. Though, at the moment, it is still at early stage, such unique opportunities can be monetized and provide fillip to the base business. Competitive Advantage: Strength Company enjoys reasonably strong competitive advantage due to combination of 	Strong brand of Radio Mirchi 	Pan-India presence with presence across all A and A+ category cities 	Pedigree of Bennet Collemn& Co which provides a distinct advantage for sourcing the advertisement and cross selling to existing client of the group In addition to above, another significant advantage for the company isits profitable operations during the testing times in last decade when most of its peers lost money heavily. This has provided company with very strong balance sheet and a war chest enabling it to take maximum advantage of upcoming auctions and carve out future growth path. Ability of financial resources may be a constraint for some of the existing players during the Phase-III auctions. Sustainability We believe that combination of brand and reach has created a competitive advantage which is sustainable at least in medium term. Management has clearly identified the strategic importance of brand has invested significant sums of money in brand building consistently over last few years. We believe that the strong brand of Radio Mirchi, managements focused and sustained efforts to build the brand, its leadership and presence in most of the metros/category A cities and increase in its reach post Phase-III expansion will not only ensure the sustainability of its competitive advantage but also strengthen it further. Quantification of Competitive Advantage I strongly believe that mere mention of competitive advantage or moat may be misleading and may tempt us to rationalize some mediocre aspects as competitive advantage. Thus, it is important to look for the competitive advantage  translating into/reflected in numbers in  at least one of the following ways for company to benefit from it. 	Pricing power (ability to command higher prices as compared to peers) 	High Entry barriers (high market share for a long time) 	Cost leadership (ability to be lowest cost producer without impacting margin for long time) Pricing Power: ENIL is enjoying significant pricing power as compared to its peers. In fact, a close analysis at advertising rates data (compiled from publicly available sources as attached in separate Excel file ENIL_Premium_pricing.xlsx (15.6 KB)) suggest following 	In 21 out of 32 cities that it operates in, ENIL commands more than 20% higher price than its nearest competitors. 	In 15 out of 32 cities, ENIL commands more than 50% price premium over its competitors 	In only 6 cities out of 32 cities, ENILs pricing is at discount to its nearest competitor Management Quality Capital Allocation: Positives:  Management is very focused on deploying the capital efficiently and this point has been reiterated by the management time and again during its conference call commentary. One of the events that may lead to sub optimal use of capital is Over paying during the auction to acquire new frequency to achieve higher growth Management is extremely cautious in this regard and has consistently maintained that they will not pay irrational price for new frequency just to ensure growth. Management has indicated number of times that companys focus is on becoming the most profitable network and not on becoming the biggest network.  In fact, one of the important reasons for ENIL remaining profitable while other players incurred significant losses during last many years, was that ENIL refrained from overpaying for acquiring new frequencies during Phase-I  & Phase-II.  Company has consistently maintained that it will retain the cash with it to ensure the sufficient war chest for bidding in Phase-III.  This is appropriate considering high return generated on the capital employed by the company.  Management has also indicated that after accounting for the capital needed for Phase-III bidding and expansion, surplus cash will be distributed liberally to the shareholders as dividend. Negatives:  In the past, company had invested money into non-radio media businesses such as outdoor media and made loss during the slow down. However, realizing that it was a very asset heavy business, management sold the business off. Corporate Governance 	Company has been run by professionals and there seems to be no interference of the promoters in the day to day running of the operations. 	Companys annual reports are fairly good and provide a good overview of the business. 	Company conducts regular conference calls and management makes all effort to provide satisfactory answer to investors queries 	Accounting policy are prudent and disclosure norms are adequate Valuation: Currently company has market capitalization of 3157 Crores. In FY 15, company made net profit of 105 odd crores and cash flow of 95 Crores. Thus, company is trading at 30 times TTM basis. Without factoring in Phase-III business opportunity and base business growth of 15%, the business is available at 25 times FY 16 earnings.

I am also cognizant of the fact that having multiple frequencies in their key markets will allow them to earn incremental revenues on much higher margins due to operating leverage. But just to play the devils advocate, let me try to put things in numbers. ENIL has invested close to 350 crores in the auctions, which means that in order to meet the post tax IRR assumption, theyre need to earn additional cash profits of 55 crores (350 crores X 16%) or so. Additionally, they will also need to recover close to 25 crores they will lose by way of interest income (post tax). So essentially, they will need to earn an additional 80 crores at the end of their stated gestation period of 2 years in order to justify the Investment. Currently they earn between 120-130 crores post tax cash profit (after adding amortisation charges) I feel is that this will be a steep challenge. I have no doubt on the managements capability but I think if anything goes wrong the downside is not protected at these valuation levels But I would love to see your calculation on the IRR if you dont mind sharing it.

ENIL_IRR.xlsx (13.3 KB)One can put in specific numbers for a city such OTEF (cash out flow), capacity utilization, realizations etc. It is important to note that the IRR is as right or wrong as our assumptions.  Hence the critical thing is to get our assumptions right. Following is the basis of my assumotions Capacity utilization: Conservative than Phase-II utilization in initial years (50-60% in 2 years) Number of slots: 17 hours a day- 14 minutes (@100%) in an hour - 6 10 second slots in a minute Realizations:  Lower/equivalent than existing realization from the city or based on other players realization EBIDTA: conservative than estimated Phase-III EBIDTA margins Tax rate: 30% flat It is important to remember that this is all equity IRR.

You are quite right in pointing out that ROIC may go down. I think that is the nature of the business and the way accounting is done. In fact, the best way to look at this business is through IRR model as company incurs one time license fees and then the capex is amortized over the life of the license period. It is very very similar to project financing. Having said that, since large portion of fixed cost increase (non-cash) in P&L is going to come from amortization charges thus impact on EBIDA will not be much but PAT will be impacted. On the other hand, the accurate reflection of such businesses shall be cash flow and not PAT. Thus one must look/value the business based on cash flow instead of PAT. Your point of high fixed cost being double edged sword is very valid as most of the time when we talk about operating leverage, we discuss that in positive light, but that is not how situations pan out in business. On drop in margins, in fact, management on record, has mentioned that even after incremental fixed cost and initial expense for new launches, on overall basis they do not expect EBIDTA margin to dip by more than 1%. That came as positive suprise to me as I was expecting decent dip in margins due to negative operating leverage. This minimal impact is due to couple of factors  There is very low additional fixed cost incurred for second and third frequency Compared to Phase-II, radio industry has matured much more thus capacity utilization ramp up will be much faster.

Most of the players have been in existence since phase-II barring some regional players in Orissa and Kerala. In the existing cities that ENIL has operations, I do not see any impact of competitive intensity impacting its realizations primarily because, theyare far ahead of its competition in many of these cities in terms of listenership and revenue share. Moreover, in many of its strong markets, it has acquired second frequency for itself and hence the real challenge is not to canniabalize its existing product in those cities. From the concall updates, it is very clear that they are targeting to monetize the second frequency with differentiated product and probably different brand. In nutshell, for its existing cities, I feel they will be able to sustain their rates. In fact, from March 2015, they had selectively started improving yields/increasing rates and management has indicated that they are boradbasing this increased rate to all existing stations and they want to continue this process going forward as well. For new cities, I feel, it will be a challenge for ENIL to compete with incumbents and hence they may have to start with much lower rates than the market leaders. Thereafter, how well they perform and get listenership will decide the trajectory of their rates in new markets. So, ENIL is yet to taste waters here. However, this is true for all player who are entering in new market and not specific to ENIL. On Profitability, according to management, inspite of rollout of new stations, higher roll out cost and negative operating leverage in new stations, the impact on EBIDTA margin is going to be only 1% on blended basis. Thus, on EBIDTA level, there is likely to be decent improvement in absolute terms if management walks the talk. One of the reasons why the impact at EBIDTA level may be minimal is because, the completely new frequencies are only 7 out of total 52 frequencies. Rest of them are either second frequencies or are acquired ones (TV Today). So, I do not see any negative impact on EBIDTA. At the same time, there is going to be a significant Amortization charge coming from One time fee for new licenses and renewal fee of existing licenses (yearly 40-45 Crore). Plus, there is interest on short term borrowing kicking in and other income from 500 Crore cash going out. Thus, for a year, the PAT may decline from current levels. So, from business operations perspective one may see positive movement but on accounting front, the numbers may look subdued. This may present a good opportunity to build position, if market ignores the operating performance and weighs the accounting earning disproportionately.

I think you have focused on two very important points that can have large impact on the business. On Phase III- Phase III auction is to be conducted in two batches. Batch 1 consisted of largely metros, category A and B cities (i.e. larger ones) while the Batch 2 will consisted of category C & D town. Thus, Batch 1 effectively symbolizes larges advertising markets while Batch 2 will mean smaller markets but wide reach. The current status is Batch 1 auctions are over and results are out. In batch 1, 3-4 players have adopted different approaches/strategies in bidding. ENIL seemed to have focused on strategy where they have worked with two objectives  To gain second frequency in most of its existing market Expanding the reach in key areas of north & north-east  So, the key points to focus for us  How well ENIL be able to capitalize on second frequency especially when other players in those markets may have idle inventory (we need to understand inventory position of other players/competitors in those markets and then understand the ability of ENIL to fill up its inventory for second frequency either through differentiated strategy or through brand pull What will be the benefit to ENIL due to increased reach in northern and north-eastern region  On the regulatory environment  The clear evolution of regulatory regime /rationale and stakeholder expectation/observation - is available on MIB website through Phase I/ Phase II/ Phase III bidding norms and regulatory structure.

Below is from AR  13. \" It is a well known fact that FM radio fares well when the economic times are bad. There are two major reasons for this. First, clients who have been bred on a diet of TV and Print are forced to re-evaluate their media mix when advertising budgets come under pressure. A re-evaluation brings to the fore, radios core strengths, often not well known to clients. Radios reach for example is far higher than prints. Radios pricing is far more reasonable than both prints and TVs. It is this combination of high reach and affordable pricing that makes radio so attractive as an advertising medium, especially during periods of economic slowdown. Second, clients tend to shift focus from nationwide pure brand-building to more tactical, local, sales-generating promotional activities. Radio, being a local medium and being the last one consumed before a brand purchase, is ideal for such activities. Both these factors have contributed to FM radios fast growth in FY13.

Some of these programming have created a unique space for itself (e.g. Mirchi Murga)   Sourcing & Creative ad solutions: This is where parentage is helping them a lot (Times of India group). In addition since they are one of the oldest players, over the years they have come up with numerous ad campaign that are best suited for radio segment and creates high impact on the listeners (e.g. they designed an ad solution for very popular local bakery shop in Ahmedabad. In this,Popular RJs  wish lucky listeners on their birthday  and send them cake. The bakery company in turn sponsors the morning show and listeners have strong brand recall of bakery shop)   Reach- Top 13 cities (Metro and Category A cities) constitute 70-75% of overall radio advertising market in India. ENIL is one of the only company to have presence in all the 13 Cities and is leading in listenership in most of them.   A combination of all these factors, puts ENIL far ahead of competition. According to my data collection, following are the cities where ENILs rates are at discount to its nearest competitor Hyderabad (-10%); Raipur (-33%); Mumbai (-31%); Jalandhar (-12%); Chennai (-23%); Varansi (-31%) Pricing power is function of Reach both in terms of listernship across demographic segments and geographical spread. Thus, a company who is present in most of the major markets with listener ship base across social and demographic strata is likely to command premium over its competitors (even though with more number of stations) who is not well spread out or is not present in major markets. A clear distinction one can make is between ENIL and Big FM. Big FM has the largest network in terms of number of stations but it hardly commands price premium in any of its markets. In terms of more granular risk, a key risk is company not able to renew/get hold in top 20 markets which constitutes more than 80% of advertising market. As of now that risk is low as ENIL already has presence in top 13 markets and has further increased its presence in Chandigarh, Cochin,  Kozikode and Amritsar which are reasonably large markets ( I feel they are in top 20 but not sure of it). However, post phase-III a key risk is to successfully pull off a strategy of launching second/third frequency without cannibalizing its existing frequency.

Both businesses are comparable except you incur a very high capex in telecom for growth and maintenance. Based on your data, I have worked out IRR for each individual city and overall. The results are attached. In major metros like Bangalore, Hyderabad, it appears they are not making any money as the IRR is very low. The big question here whether the second rung cities will be able to compensate the loss in metros. For the new licences which is not covered in your list, I have taken the maximum advertising rate of the Category from your list ie for Cochin, Chandigarh, etc Some of the cities like Bangalore , Pune, Ahmedabad,Jaipur, etc they have bid heavily - Compare the migration Vs new licence fees. I will also work out for migration and new put together and see if there is any improvement in present IRR from the new licence IRR 15%.

Further, the biggest risk is the advertising rate and volume for this business as compared to ARPU and subs in telecom IMHO an investment more of defensive nature giving steady returns and not growth , unless there is a dramatic shift in advertising rates ( a big ???) due to change in competitive landscape.

However, the key to understand the numbers are assumptions. What all assumptions you have taken to arrive at cash flows for city on following  Inventory utilization; advertising rates; FCF to Revenue ratio and number of available slots in a year  Without this, it will be difficult to comment on final numbers. However, my numbers based on following assumptions are coming out differently than yours. Following are my assumptions  No of slots in a year (17 hr * 14 min ad inventory/hour * 6 slots per min * 350 days opeations)- roughly 500,000 slots Ad realization for second frequency- 60%-65% of prevailing rates of ENIL in first couple of years and then the gap narrowing down (i.e. for Ahmedabad, prevailing rates are Rs. 700 for 10 second slot, for second frequency in ahmedabad, the realization will be 420-460 Rs for 10 second slot in first couple of years) Inventory utilization: 50-60% in 1st year; 2nd year-60-70%, 3rd year 80% and 4th & 5th year 90%  and 6th year onward 100%+. We also need to factor in higher EBIDTA margin for second/third frequency stations due to synergy and cost savings. Thus, I feel they can start with 30% kind of EBIDTA margin from first year of operation if they can achieve 50% utilization  All these put together, they can get 20%+ IRR on realistic basis for new frequencies. In addition, we shall factor in that IRR for existing  station migrating to Phase III is very very high as the migration fee is 1/3 to 1/5th of the new license fee while the utilization levels are close to 100% and ad rates are also much higher. Thus, on combined basis, I will not be surprised if they generate 25%+ IRR on 700 odd crores that they will put in for new licenses and migration. Again, as I said, the whole basis for the calculations is  assumptions on 4-5 key parameters and we need to see how they pan out as things progress.

Key points IMO First let me clarify that it wasnt weak quarter in operating terms. You have to remember that this is a quarter where we have invested hugely in phase three so almost Rs 700 crore of investments have happened during the quarter. So, a lot of a treasury income is really down and that is why you will notice that at profit after tax (PAT) level we are have reported a de-growth actually. If you therefore pass the business and look at how the business is by itself even our operating PAT for instances is up about 18-19 percent. So, the business has been strong in fact revenue growth at 23 percent reflects a very strong business. Now you asked about marketing and marketing is a sustained effort. I have been mentioned this for couple of quarters now that we will be stepping up marketing and that is exactly what we have done. So, you will notice that TV campaign of course much of that effect will come in this quarter but we are preparing for our roll out and I think that will be a sustained effort.  I am very happy to report that again on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis we are focusing more on the price increase because there really isnt much volume left in longer. So, if you look at the 23 percent revenue growth almost about two-third of that has come from a price increase and only about a third of it has come from volume increase. That is going to be the way going forward as well.  remember whatever demand we have is coming more from the consumer side of the economy and that to very urban consumer side of the economy and that is exactly where radio is look at it today. Given, for instances e-commerce, e-commerce is a very urban and very consumer kind of category and all media companies are benefiting enormously from e-commerce. So, that is the way it is, I believe radio in the next five years is in a terrific sweet spot and we should see continue growth.  We dont give margins but all that I can say is that while margins will dip obviously because of treasury income. I think underlying business to continue to remain very robust. Hopefully, by the end of FY17 we will again be a debt free company so that should tell you that we expect margins to be good.

Following facts that you mentioned - are really noteworthy for me - while thinking about the current attractiveness of the business a) post round 1 of Phase 3 (which is behind us and companies have already committed capital), very little capital requirement for new frequencies is envisaged in next 5 years b) The business characteristic is such that 70-75% of the cost is fixed cost and hence there exist strong operating leverage. Any incremental capacity utilization beyond breakeven point, largely flows to bottom line. Thus, the margin improvement is very sharp post break even point. Break even point for new stations to be launched is indicated as 1.5 to 2 years c) Second/third frequencies will have significantly higher margins due to lot of shared cost (infrastructure, overheads, marketing etc). This will mean, overall margin on steady state basis will be much higher than current EBIDTA margin of 36%+. My observations/queries - to think through and critique deeper First the good parts  This certainly looks like a differentiated business in an industry - doing consistently well in an industry, where others have struggled/struggling. In a sense, it is walking a path that others should be knowing well, but For some reason arent/choosing not to/or, cannot. That is the first point that attracts to me to look deeper - to find the answers to our next set of questions.  2.a) Long Runway - certainly FM radio as a medium is relevant, and many more years of growth ahead b) Sustainability of competitive advantage - has been the most consistently profitable, and looks to have advanced its lead over competition with latest phase III auction execution - advantageously placed in most of the growth markets; strong support and recognition that it garners by being a group company of the Times Group - and its association with over 25000 advertisers - that group advantage should continue to aid the companys future growth plans. Hard to envisage who/what can dislodge this business from its strong perch - isko hilane wala kaun hai?? 3.Future Growth - increasing the distance with peers/other players 2nd frequency in 9 out of 13 top cities (70% of FM industry revenues); the nearest competitor has bagged the 2nd frequency in only 2 cities?? this seems like a huge huge lead - even consolidation among others may not be able to take this away. How much of a strategic advantage is this?? of course, this is all linked to successful execution of second/niche branding emerging - an act of faith if you like - the 3 Metro 2nd licenses (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata from Oye stable) - still not allowed by MIB and under litigation - are of strategic importance again - this is more than an optionality in near future - do we have a way to put a number to this? International market launch in UAE, any sense where this is and any timeframes when international could be significant? 4.Predictability of the business - This I where I need to think lot more on - has impact on valuations/Margin of Safety thinking I am wary of government/regulatory stance changing suddenly - like it did in the case of Telecom - where license augmentation/renewal terms completely deteriorated the picture; FM Phase III has just been concluded, but what about the earlier licenses? Perhaps the impact of this in FM radio case is far away?- as Top 13 cities - constituting 70% revenues - license renewal is still many years away?? Implementation of an accurate nationwide measurement mechanism for FM radio that will evaluate returns across FM stations - without something like that - how strong is the lead? if something like this is in the offing - can it bring disruptive changes in advertising patterns form broadcasters? eCommerce share of the advertising pie (currently 10%+) is certain to slow down as the funding frenzy has considerably slowed down - and can affect contribution significantly in Fy2017 The advertising industry fortunes are linked closely to the economy. When economy slows down - to manage their profits better, advertisers will cut advertising spend. And when the economy lifts, advertisers start putting monies back with a lag effect. In many ways, advertising is the first to be cut, and the last to be re-instated. How does FM advertising behave in that context? in 2008 industry was still very nascent - now the impact could be much more??

There is no evident source of moat  desaidhwanilDhwanil DesaiTop Contributor21h    Donald @Donald Thanks for digging deeper and raising very pertinent questions. It is critical to form a balanced view on investment hypothesis and have the downsides/risks analyzed from various perspectives/angles. Regarding your specific points, here are the point wise responses Renewal of existing licenses: First the bad part: Government policies/regulations remain one of the most important risks for ENIL storyand for that matter the whole industry. We have umpteen examples in the past where government, in its own wisdom, have come out with regulations that has changed the economic characteristic of the whole industry for worse (i.e telecom) or disincentivised the private investment in the sector (oil & gas). Is there a likelihood of something similar happening in Radio? we surely can not rule it out if we go by the history. The good part: Renewal for all its existing 32 stations happened along with Phase-3 and the licenses for all the stations (barring Goa, which ENIL relented due to unattractiveness of the license commercially and/or strategically) for 15 years. That means, at least for 15 years, we can expect a stable regime for existing stations and license fee has been paid for it. So, the risk, if at all, is in very distant future. Also, we shall recognize, that the growth for the industry is more likely to come from government releasing ample supply of frequencies which will result in increasing the pie for the industry. The regulations are relevant for the supply of frequency and the reserve price set for these frequencies (very similar to Telecom industry). At the moment, there is no regulations governing the ad inventory and/or the pricing for ad inventory. However, one of the possible risks can be the regulations related to cap on ad inventory as proposed in TV channels (Though that too is not yet implemented) Measurement mechanism: I think you have captured a very relevant and yet often ignored point. This is very essential for radio ad market growth. Typically, in all media segments, measurement systems (be it TRP, readership or listenership) acts as advertising currency and accurate and reliable measurement provides advertisers confidence about the efficacy of the ad spend that they do. At the moment, there is no reliable and scientific measurement system for radio listener ship in place. Thus, whatever leadership that we are suggesting in the investment hypothesis is not based on consistently reliable, objective and upto date measurement system(i.e the latest listnership data is available from IRS 2014which is two years old and the IRS measurement philosophy itself is challenged by many industry players). If, such objective measurement system does not evolve in near to medium term future, with current expansion of Phase-3 to 800 odd frequencies, it will be very difficult for advertisers and media planners to make informed decisions (ROI generated on ad spend) on adspend and allocate higher budget to radio as medium. E commerce share of advertising pie- Amongst all risks, I see this as relatively lower risk and transient in nature (high probability, low impact risk). E-commerce is the fastest growing segment for most of the radio companies including ENIL. As you suggested, it constitutes 10% of their overall revenue (almost doubled in a year). Going forward, it appears inevitable that consolidation will happen in the e-commerce industry and smaller players will fall out. This will have an impact on the ad spend by them as well. However, if you listen to ENIL management, they are very cognizant of this fact. MD is very categorical that spend by e-comm companies is going to go off cliff in near term (in his opinion 6 months). At the same time, they see that compensated by much better traction in telecom spend, consumer discretionary and auto. Impact of economic slow down on Ad spend: Your point is valid in the context of overall media spend. However, the pricing dynamics is such that, radio as medium gets more allocation in advertising spend during the economic slowdown due to two reasons (based on past management commentary and my limited understanding of the industry)   Radio, traditionally, has been seen as more effective medium for discounts/promotions than for branding (Where visual impact/images are more relevant), though that too is slowly changing.However, for the time being, if we accept this notion, In times of economic slow down, companies run number of promotional schemes/campaign to spur the demand. This helps the radio players.   Media planners, due to constrained budget, look for medium where the cost of reaching customer is lowest per rupee spent. Radio, among all medium, is the best bet for them.   Thus, I feel, economic slowdown may less pronounced impact on ad revenues than other mediums like print and TV. I hope I am able to address some of the points you have raised.  DonaldDonald FrancisAdmin, Top Contributor20h 1 Thanks Dhwanil for pointed responses. Most of the regulatory/government mischief/misadventures come about when new spectrum is to be distributed, or licences to be renewed, etc. So having valid licences for next 15 years provides great comfort, on continued business predictability. Though sudden turns in policy in between cannot be ruled out. I am purposely trying to put on the questioning hat  Will next put my mind to Competitive dynamics - the current happy picture on this front remaining unchallenged - how sanguine can we be on that front. Let me do some thinking/familiarising and come back on that. But before that I would like you to share your thoughts on this other crucial part 3. Future Growth - increasing the distance with peers/other players 2nd frequency in 9 out of 13 top cities (70% of FM industry revenues); the nearest competitor has bagged the 2nd frequency in only 2 cities?? this seems like a huge huge lead - even consolidation among others may not be able to take this away. How much of a strategic advantage is this?? or this is transient like some others opine?         ',NULL,'2016-03-16 15:53:54'),(9340,510,1910,'@Donald It is always good to have someone wearing questioning hat and playing devils advocate.It is distinctly advantageous for an investor to have such some one for each of his/her investment thesis because If the Devils advocate is able to prevail upon in his/her arguments then an investor will be saved from potential big losses otherwise, one comes out with much higher conviction about the investment idea from the processso thanks for wearing questioning hat for ENIL. Will reserve my views on competitive dynamics, till your usual probing questions come! Coming to your query on lead by ENIL through second frequency and strategic importance of it, I feel, at the moment the jury is divided. One of the primary reason for the difference in opinion is that there is no precedence/track record of operating such second frequencies in same city to compare how it will play out. This has led many people to be skeptical about the success of the business model. Though, a bit biased, here is my thought process on the same  In last 10 years, the pre-dominance of top 13 market has remained constant and even after Phase-2 expansion, where many more new cities got new frequencies and came onstream. In fact, top 13 markets have been able to maintain its revenue share or increase it despite of the addition of new cities. Thus, it is fully fathomable, that going forward, the same will continue Relevance of the top 13 markets for advertisers is immense. Typically, advertisers want to spend money where the population density is high, disposable income is high and the customers/listeners have certain characteristics.(in media parlance SEC A & B). Advertisers get a large population of urban consumers in SEC A & B segments. Also, many of the A+ and A category consumers are early adopters hence are more conducive for any new product launches etc As Indian GDP grow, the urbanization is going to increase and already large cities are going to get larger thus, further providing tailwind to consumption in the cities and in turn to media spend.  Thus, I feel, that over a period of time, large part of additional media spend is still going to top 13-15 cities and ad markets in these top 13 cities are going to larger and larger. When one combines this with no new frequencies to be allotted in near future in these top 13 cities , already overflowing inventory in these cities and ENILs intention to provide differentiated content/product means a significant strategic advantage for some time to come. Just to give some color to the skewness of the market, Only Delhi and Mumbai put together account for 400 odd crores of ad market for radio (i.e. 30% of the total radio industry and 40% of Top 13 market). Hence, any player who is well entrenched is going to benefit immensely while others may have to wait for next opportunity to participate in these markets (and from what I understand, participate they willat much higher reserve prices!:-))         ',NULL,'2016-03-17 17:09:18'),(9341,510,1917,'@Donald @desaidhwanil A different view on the 2nd frequency issue. If you look at a similar experience in development markets, additional frequencies or channels/ pipes is the norm. Earlier we had AM/FM, then we have satellite (Sirius XM) and now we have pandora/ spotify etc. So in a way, distribution channels continue to poliferate and as a result the toll bridge kind of economics of some of the media players is reducing. This not news and explains the rise of Netflix and other providers If we apply a similar analogy, the second frequency and online in india is the same trend. I would guess the online channel is going to become as important in next 5 years. If it has already hit the inflection in video in developed markets, it is not a stretch for the radio/ FM. In the above scenario, one can look at the example of sirius XM and how they have responded to this threat Sirius XM has taken the route of differentiated content which is not available elsewhere. due to the high number of subsrcibers (from existing and presold satellite radios in new cars), they are able to develop this content and amortize over a large base (look at the example of the howard stern show). its expensive to produce this content and acts a barrier to entry. In a similar fashion, i would say that the brand building is really the key for ENIL and i think they have been rightly focussed on it. The next phase of evolution could be differentiated content as they mention. Once you combine this content, with a strong brand and large customer base the channel of distribution becomes less important. The monetization can then be based on ads or subscription or a mix of both         ',NULL,'2016-03-17 18:51:27'),(9342,510,1918,'Is there a way to get insight on latest RAM(Radio Audience Measurement by Nielsen) ratings? and is there a better rating scale?

If you use the model of nextflix, some of the content is undifferentiated, but then one is not paying anything (or minimal) to get the content. ENIL then acts as a dumb pipe for the content. Ofcourse i am over simplifying here as ENIL is not a dumb pipe and provides curation (pre-selects) of content for a user. Free or cheap content has now been available in all developed markets for a long time and with cheaper bandwidth the same will happen in india. But, i think as investors we over-estimate this risk as we tend to undervalue the important of pre-selection and time. One can get a lot of free content on you tube, but then you have to wade through a ton of garbage to find something useful. In comparison an ENIL, curates content for you via shows and thus one is spared of that work. On top of that as ENIL builds differentiated content, the stickiness increases (look at the sirius XM subscriber counts and average subscription rates for reference) I personally prefer to analyse ENIL as a media company which a combination of brand and curated/ differentiated content. As the company invests in these variables, it attracts more listeners, which allows ENIL to invest more driving a positive loop. Ad rates are just a derivative of the above and as long as the brand is built, content developed, listeners and ad rates will follow the channel - Frequency 1 or 2 or online etc are just distribution channel.

It helps newbies like me to take my analysis a step further. Here is my opinion on ENIL. Please do have a read. Excuse if there are any blatant misses and misunderstanding and highlight Technology is disruptive, it just changes the way of things very fast. Something which has already matured in developed nations and is in its nascent stages in emerging ones need not necessarily live up to its maturity, may die very early itself. Im not saying the Radio will die. For example, 60% of Americans have landline phones, whereas the number is almost non existent in African countries. The number is going down in India too. Cell phone has taken over the landlines. On similar lines, like pointed out by @varadharajanr  I feel that the advent of digital advertising and music apps pose a bigger danger than others to the radio here in India. Most of the radio stations in India predominantly just air songs, the programs are very minimal, whereas the extent of programs in America is quite sizeable. Though even there the shows with most listenership are the music ones, the news and talk shows contribute significantly. The talk shows are a big big hit(This can be a potential moat, if at all there is). The dynamics there are different from what is here in India, so comparing ours with theirs will not give us a proper view. With the internet set to grow in the years to come, and looking at the growth of internet and the track record around the world, it will become more affordable. The probability of apps like Gaana, wynk etc doing good doesnt look very bleak. Our radio airs mostly music and a very few talk shows or movie reviews or anything of that sort. My own experience is that I just browse channels till i find someone that plays music. Why would I listen to some random ads in between which I actually dont want to. As such, I do not see any moat with respect to Brand name or programs as they just play songs. The distribution and the reach maybe, which others can eat into. I may be wrong though. The apps allow to download and play music which is what the radio here predominantly does. Whatsapp almost killed sms today, lets say for example, those same people just jump ship to these apps it might start the next exodus similar to whatsapp. These numbers maybe small, but nevertheless do count as it starts the next movement. When will this happen?, Will it? I dont have answers, but we all know that technology is disruptive. Who knows, the next morning we might wake up to Gaana than Mirchi.

Global players like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music each pays between 60-75% of their revenues to the music providers. In India, the fgures are possibly worse, with players like Gaana and Saavn having to pay huge Minimum Guarantees (MGs) in addition to very high perstream costs (A stream is basically one song played out to one listener. If 1 million listeners listen to 5 songs each for example, thats 5 million streams). MG makes the streaming business virtually a non-starter in India, as most streaming services incur more than 100% of their revenues in just music costs. This aside, the music industry issues licenses only for short periods of time  a maximum of two years. After that, they raise the MGs again, and usually very signifcantly. Streaming services which have managed to catch-up with previous MGs suddenly fnd themselves back in the red again. Then there is the global phenomenon of users not willing to pay for the service. This problem is especially true in developing countries. In China, out of nearly 500 million users of streaming services, not more than 10 million pay for the service. In India, overall streaming numbers are much smaller (Monthly Active Users  MAUs  are of the order of 30 million or so), but the free nature of the business is similar. As a result of this, streaming services are forced to rely on advertising revenues. Till the streaming numbers grow, and till a large number of people start using these services regularly, advertising monies will be slow to come. It is reported that streaming services are losing hundreds of crores of rupees every year and there is no certainty that this will come down in the near future.

Theres no visible trend that people would increasingly move to this channel. In fact most of the demographic will move away from Radio if data becomes cheaper(which has been the trend since the advent of Jio). Traction of Radio advertising: Again channel shift is occurring towards digital platforms. Also,  the target high impact demographic is MOVING AWAY from radio due to traditional advertising models. Traditional Advertising Model: Traditional advertising models are falling apart. Theyre low on engagement, theres no way to gauge their impact and radio channels themselves have very low customer loyalty to make a listener sit through these ads. Concept of personalized recommendations: Apple music wants to make it big in India. Pandora and Spotify want to target India. People want personalized recommendations and curated music. My mother herself now listens to music on the Gaana and Saavn apps. She has completely turned the plug on radio for last 6 years. No or minimal customer loyalty: Ever boarded an Uber or Ola. How many of your drivers sit through those radio ads? Theres minimal stickiness on the channel with almost no content differentiation. NO CONTENT DIFFERENTIATION allows for easy customer drift.

ENIL growth is 18%  indicating improving market share FOR FY 17 total income :549 cr(+12%),EBITDA :126cr (- 21%),PAT: 54cr (-49%). 70% is from radio and remaining from non radio business. 	 Radio industry  growth  without new stations for FY17 is - 3%. With new station industry overall grew by 5%  which is slowest growth in last several  years( impact  of demonetization q3/q4). Currently  ENIL is operating  49 stations in 39 cities. In 9 cities mirchi has 2 frequencies ( 3 frequencies in Hyderabad) New stations: 	New stations contribution to q4 revenue is  16 cr with ebitda loss of 6 cr. For fy17 new stations revenue is 31 cr. 50% of which came  in Q4 indicating  that these stations started  to show momentum. For the year EBITDA loss from new stations 29 cr, bulk of which(23 cr) came in first 9 months. Q4 ebitda loss is just 6cr. Likely to breakeven  by FY18 end. 	 New stations has done well (particularly bengaluru,hyderabad and Chandigarh) in terms listenership or pricing for ad reaching top 3 positions in those cities. Maintaining premium pricing at bengaluru and hyderabad which is leading to slower volumes build up. New station at bengaluru (mirchi 95) pricing is 10% higher than legacy station (mirchi 98.3) with capacity utilization of 41% in Q4. Hyderabad new station also priced at 5 to 10% higher but utilisation is 25%. Chandigarh  is priced at same level of competitors with 33% utilization. Mirchi is usually the market leader in pricing. Not trying to undercut the market with low pricing. These new stations can grow 3 to 6 times depending on market. New station may reach EBITDA of 45 to 50%  after few years. 	Marketing spending for new stations is mostly upfront and heavy in first year which gets tapered off by third year. Second frequency in existing cities not cannibalizing the revenue but conscious about the listenership cannibalization and working on that. Update on stations acquired from TV TODAY: 	Four stations acquired from tv today doing well with doubling of revenue from the time of acquiring . Presently operating at 25% EBITDA. Mirchi has  sale agreement for remaing 3 TV today radio stations which underwent revamp  as ISHQ FM . These stations have  been positioned as premium channel with premium pricing ad rate . May take time to increase the volume due to more competitive market in these cities. Acceptance of ISHQ fm has been very good. Nonradio business : 	grew by 36% in Q4 which contributed  largely to overall growth of 18%. Encouraging to do concert  business  with new stations which helps in building brand and revenue. 	 Focus for next 3 to 4yrs is on improving the profitability from low double digit to 30% levels. Strategy: 	Radio industry is losing listeners due to excess ad.  Total no of radio listeners doesnt seem to be  increased   inspite of new channels addition by industry . Whole industry seems to have realized this and  trying to cut ad time. 	 ENIL  has  cut the ad time by 4 min/hr in top 10 markets.  During peak advertising like Diwali/christmas inventory will be limited to 18 min/hr instead of 22min and 14 min /hr in non -peak season. Should be able to offset volume growth with pricing. Essentially pricing has to increased by 22% to compensate for cut in inventory .  Most of this will happen with upcoming season and end of FY18 	Car driving audience  has become biggest target for radio industry and advertisers. Almost 75% of the car were tuned to FM radio. With increase in no of cars this segment is likely to increase further. 	Impact of new phase 3 players: As most of the frequencies  acquired at high rate unlikely to see underpricing and taking away market share. 	GST may hold advertisers impacting q1 and q2 nos. GST is positive for non FCT business. Pricing and utilization: 	Legacy 32 stations: Price was up by 12% in Q4 & for full year price is up by 7.6%. Price :10,727 FOR FY17. FOR Q4: 12,029. 	Utilization (based on 13 min): 98% in FY17. top 8 stations:118% ,remaining 24 stations:91%. 	For new stations:  Price 4,250 for fy17( not clear about this). capacity utilizations is around 15%. Impact of digital radio: provides big opportunity for existing players. With understanding of consumer needs,music and technology will be able to transfer from traditional FM to onlineFM. Already have strong  presence in facebook/youtube/twitter and instagram. Presently have 19 online radio stations, will be reaching  50 online stations soon. Doing lot of creative  audio video work in digital  space  for clients.  Already 300 people are working on this. Company does not need to employ extra  for this. Going to position itself as full on  entertainment company rather just music player. New auction /M&A  oppurtunities: 	Picked up 21 new stations in second batch  with total bid amount of 51 Cr. These are  relatively small stations  but economically viable.Plan to do networking in these stations so that content/people/establishment and marketing cost will be very low.( DOES IT MEAN THEY OPERATE VARIOUS STATIONS FROM SINGLE LOCATION?) 	During last auction only 25% of licences were taken up. Future batches with smaller cities failure rate is going to be high for Govt. 	By april next year M&A oppurtunities will available but company will focus on consolidating existing channels  for next 2 to 3 years.

Radio is high operating leverage business.  Top line drop resulted in significant drop in ebita margin and bottom line_(this has been explained  very well by Dhwanil in his goa presentation)_ Reasons for drop in revenue: * Lingering effects of  demonetisation: impacts still persist affecting  retail /small clients/real   	   estate. * Impact of  RERA: Builders not allowed to advertise on new projects unless registered with   	RERA. Significant revenue for radio industry comes from real estate on new project launches                               	which was impacted severely. Real estate is big contributor to  radio industry ads. in volume   	terms its down by 21% for ENIL  its down byas in some markets the contribution from RE 	was high for ENIL. *GST IMPACT:  Advertising by all the sectors  including real estate was down significantly 	during the month of june *Radio industry top 8 categories (govt,fmcg,automobile,education,real estate,media,travel 	and .com in the order) collectively dropped by 20%. Biggest drop was in govt/ political ad 	spend on high base of  last year, around 19% of radio industry revenue  is from govt. 		Typically govt ad spend is divided (volume)among all players  equally but price varies for    	each player depending  on listenership. Mirchi market share in govt ad spend is around 25%.   	For mirchi the govt ad drop is 70% against 30% for industry. Comment about other radio players  growth: *one player has added two  large metro  city station on small base  which contributed to 	  growth .If we exclude the new stations contribution growth will b negative. One more  	      	  player  growth may be 2 to 3%  after excluding the new stations. Their growth may be due 	   to strategy of accepting ads at low price.(I think he was speaking about Music broad c ltd). Non radio business : grew by 17% in Q1FY18. Contributed 27% of overall revenue in Q1.  Margin contribution increased to 37% from 29%. It is fast growing  segment in industry. ENIL focus  is on profitability. CAPACITY utilisation:( based on 13min/hr and 17hrs/day) *core 36 stations:60% in Q1FY 18 v/s  93% in Q1FY17. * top 8 stations : 86% in Q1FY 18 v/s  113% in Q1FY17. *New stations: 20%. Pricing  and strategy:  price  is up by 11% yoy.  Mirchi has established  top price in all the cities. Even the second frequency/new channels have  has kept at  higher price. In cities like Bengaluru/Hyderabad price for new  mirchi love station is higher than legacy mirchi station. Other cities pricing is at par or 2nd to mirchi. In media industry achieving  higher price is important which gives sustainability for next 15 yrs. ENIL is not going to cut the price to increase volumes. Its very difficult to increase price again once reduced. High price resulted in low capacity utilisation. During  last year peak season(diwali)  ad time cap was for 22min/hr. Plan to reduce this to 18min/hr to build listenership and maintain high price. Market may take another 3 to 6 months to recover. July has been bad for advertising industry. With festival season/H2  it may recover with good volumes.  Strategy of high pricing will be reviewed  if current situation continues in H2/festive season. Core 36 stations : de-growth  is 15%,  cost increased by only 1.5%. Wants to keep  the cost low which results in improving margins when revenue recovers. Not much marketing spend  for stations**. Core stations EBITA will be 30 to 35%.** New stations:  EBITA loss is reduced to 5 cr ,will be profitable by end of  FY18. EXPECT THE CAPACITY UTILISATION IN NEW STATION TO REACH 60 TO 70% IN FESTIVE SEASON FROM CURRENT 20%. When new station is launched first few months is to build brand/listenership ,revenue by 3-4 quarter then to concentrate on margins by 8 quarters. Old mirchi  stations is not loosing revenues  to new station as not  many common advertisers. local advertisers  will contribute significantly (70%) when new  station is launched. This will change over few years  when national advertise increases. New channels are not empelled for govt ads. Listenership/ research:  no  absolute increase in radio listenership due high ad time. ENIL does listenership survey with respected global companies whose data will be shared with customers to command high premium pricing. Maximum radio  listening(80%) happens on mobile phones. 75% of cars are tuned to FM. Many of newer mobile phones doesnt have FM TUNER which is threat to fm industry.  JIO smart phones which is going  to be launched and expected to replace 50% of phones will have FM tuner. DIGITAL : have 21 online streaming stations. Launching new digital channels for young  who can listen to radio on smart phone with minimal data consumption. Making lot of video /content/programmes /online radio stations for sponsors for online business. Trying to monetise the online stations. presently revenue from digital is  less than 1%. This can rise to 10% of revenue. Capex/new launches:  25 crs for this FY. Only three stations from batch 1 auction yet to be launched. Jammu and Calicut will launched in august. Srinagar launch will take time. Batch 2 stations  roll out  starts in next 6-9 months. These are all small station. Not much spend is expected.

Few points noted/interpretation : 1.DAVP (Directorate of advertising  and visual publicity(DAVP) is the nodal agency for Govt ad through FM channels. 2.Minimum  broadcast period of six months and at least 16hr/day. This will be by verified by DAVP after going through last 6 months program schedule of the FM channel, that means FM channel has to broadcast  for at least 6 months before applying for  the  Govt empanelment. 3. Once empanelled, FM station will remain on panel for period of 10 yrs. During the last year FM channel can apply for renewal. 4. Rate structure: varies based on city category/time band. Listenership  data as per IRS 2012 is taken into account while calculating rate .As mentioned by Mr Prashant  pandey  during concall new IRS is due to be out in few months.

The external challenge is related to way the media spend is moving from traditional media to digital media. To compound on that, the economy has been in doldrums and media spend is directly correlated to GDP growth. Thus, the base business is facing significant challenges. Eventhough Newspapers are worst impacted in traditional media spend, Radio too has bear the burnt. The internal challenge I feel is with respect to the utilization level of the new frequency that they acquired couple of years back. Capacity utilization on new frequencies remained very low at around 25-30%. We must understand that operating leverage is a double edge sword. Hence when business doesnt scale up while you continue to incur the fixed cost, it creates drag on the P&L. My personal sense is that strategy of bidding for second frequency in the same market (where it was present with Mirchi brand) has backfired as it has cannibalized the Mirchi market and shunted the growth in new frequency. Obviously, there is no data point to prove this, inspite of good content, marketing and differential positioning (less adds, romantic songs - Mirchi Love) if the advertisers are not getting onboarded, this seems a logical inference to make. Their non-radio and activation business has been doing well scaling up with improved margins. However, it has not moved the needle in terms of profitability. The only saving grace is the cash flow. They have been generating good cash flow from business and have repaid loan and are accumulating cash again. However, the due to shift of adspend from traditional to digital media - the earlier industry growth of 13-15% looks very difficult to achieve. New normal to me seems mid-high single digits.

Digital products either sold independently or as part of Solutions packages contributed to 12% of total revenues. We expect this to increase to nearly 25% of total revenues by FY25. Mirchi digital is currently reaching an estimated 50 million users through multiple platforms like Social Media, YouTube, music OTTs, etc.   During the year, Mirchis social media footprint grew impressively. Between its own handles and those belonging to its RJs, Mirchi had a reach of nearly 23 million on Facebook and 10 million on Instagram. On YouTube, its subscriber base grew to 13 million this year. Total views on our YouTube channels increased to nearly 800 million during the year.   In the US,   we have been present on FM in the second most important market for radio for South Asians  New Jersey (NJ)  since Jan 26th, 2019.   We have also been available across the US via our radiomirchiusa app.   In July 2021, we launched a powerful AM station in the number 1 radio market  the Bay Area in California.   We have also launched an online Telugu radio station on our app that specifically targets the Telugu people living in California. Even though its content is designed for California, it is available all over the US.   Over the last couple of years, the feedback on the product has been very encouraging, and it reflects in our revenue share, which is estimated to be close to 50% in NJ. We are confident of replicating this success in the Bay Area next year.   In the US, your Company has signed a lease agreement for a frequency 1170 AM  in the Bay Area. This is a powerful frequency that covers the whole Bay area  from San Francisco to San Jose. The Bay Area is the biggest radio market for South Asians in the US. We hope to launch commercial operations soon.   During the year, we returned the New York frequency to its owner because the owner wanted to sell it, and it was anyway not proving to be viable.     Mirchi was present in Bahrain under a brand licensing arrangement with a local partner till September 2019, after which our partner decided to surrender the license. After making a bid on our own in November 2019, ENIL won the bid in June 2020. We have now relaunched Mirchi in Bahrain on May 9th, 2021, through a 100% owned subsidiary called Mirchi Bahrain WLL. Initial audience and client feedback have been good.   In our first stint in the UAE, in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Media Corporation, we had become the number 1 broadcaster across the country. In our second stint, this time in partnership with Dolphin Records, we have made a strong come-back in March 2021   A shareholder agreement was signed between ENIL, Global Entertainment Network Limited (GENL), Marhaba FM and Mr. Salem Fahad S E Al-Naemi to operate a radio station in Doha, Qatar. Marhaba FM holds a commercial radio broadcasting station license for the FM frequency 89.6 in the state of Qatar and it was operating under the brand name One FM. GENL is the wholly owned subsidiary of Marhaba FM. In March2021 ENIL made an equity investment that gave us a 49% stake in the share capital of GENL. GENL shall provide services to Marhaba FM in connection with operating the station under the brand name MirchiOne. Despite multiple obstacles faced, including travel restrictions, MirchiOne was launched in Qatar on 21st March2021.   Normally adverse economic conditions benefit radio, as advertisers spend more on promotions rather than core brand building . However, the pandemic is unique because it has disrupted the retail sector the most. With retail shut, there was no scope to run promotions . Radio depends heavily on retail advertising and so it has suffered a lot.   Solutions and Digital.   During the year, both saw a significant improvement in gross margins. Solutions gross margin improved to 52.7% from 38.4% last year and digitals gross margin improved to 37.5% from 11.5% last year. Since both products are dependent on advertising, revenues fell during the year.   In FY21, we have taken the first steps towards building our own digital web and app platforms . The big gain in having our own platform is that we will finally own the customer. We will also own the ad inventory on the platform. This will future-proof the Company against any more economic disruptions and crises like the pandemic.   In line with this vision, your Company took the bold decision to drop the word Radio from its logo Radio Mirchi. The brand will now be known simply as Mirchi. This decision allows the brand to do so much more than just radio  original videos, original podcasts, live events, TV impact properties, solutions etc.   Because of the pandemic, the on-ground component of solutions was badly hit. It was down 92% over FY20. But our multi-media solutions component fared much better, dropping by only 16%. The solutions we designed for our clients using TV  what we call TV impact properties like Mirchi Music Awards  dropped by only 37%. Despite solutions products dropping, the margins of the solutions business rose strongly from 38% to 53%.   Mirchi now runs 18 web radio stations on Gaana including exclusive Punjabi and Marathi stations for metro markets like Delhi & Mumbai.   Mirchis selected content is also available on Amazon Alexa, making us part of the growth story of smart speakers and smart homes in India.   As a focused business line, Mirchi continues to create original visual content (Web series) and thereby ride on the growth of video OTT platforms in India. While the number of shows created during the year were less due to Covid restrictions, this will continue to be a major thrust area for Mirchi in the days to come especially since Mirchis talent and capabilities in multiple Indian languages places us in a unique position to grow this vertical.   In FY21, digital products, either sold independently, or as part of solutions, grew to approx. ` 32 crores, contributing about 12% to revenues. This 12% is part of the 1/3rd share of solutions. One of the positive impacts of this replacement of on-ground activities with digital was that gross margins increased to more than 50%. As is known, margins on on-ground activities are a little limited.   In order to add muscle to the solutions and digital businesses, your Company has invested in people, processes, training and software . Most of the programming team members are now making content not only for radio, but also for client solutions and digital platforms.     As a result of the Companys right sizing exercise, the headcount of the Company came down from 1124 at the beginning of the year to 910 at the end . In addition, senior employees took pay cuts ranging from 10% to 50% from April 2020 to February 2021 . Many employees were put on Part-Work-Part-Pay (PWPP) in which they worked for half the week and received half pay   The annual incentive program was disbanded for all people in the first half of the year and though a special incentive plan was introduced for the 2nd half, no one was able to earn any incentive.   Vaccination doses have been provided free of cost to all employees, including the support staff. Employees were also offered the option of taking interest-free loans to pay for Covid related expenses. Employees were also encouraged to take an extra week off, a leave that we called recharge leave.   In another case, your Company won an order from the Delhi HC which stated that radio broadcasters did not need to take any license for the underlying works in a sound recording viz the lyrics and compositions. As a result of this, your Company was able to write back past provisions made to the tune of Rs. 23.5 crores .   Financials   On a consolidated basis, total income of the Company declined from Rs. 56,153.32 lakhs during the previous year to Rs. 29,117.52 lakhs during the year under review. Profit after tax declined from Rs. 1,071.21 lakhs during the previous year to loss of Rs. (11,050.31) lakhs during the year under review.   In the 1st quarter, your Companys revenues were down 72%. In the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters, revenue was down 59%, 42% and 34% respectively.   Radio ad volumes took a hit in the 1st half of the year falling by 74% in the 1st quarter and 27% in the 2nd quarter but recovered smartly in the 2nd half. Ad volumes grew by 1% and 6% respectively in the 3rd and 4th quarters. Pricing of radio however continued to remain lower by about 25% throughout the year .   Recovery typically follows this pattern  first the volumes recover, then the pricing.   The recovery continued into the 1st quarter of FY22. However, the 2nd wave of the pandemic has paused it. Recovery may now be delayed till the end of the 2nd wave, but the experience of the last year has shown that the demand for radio remains strong. With vaccinations growing rapidly, it is our hope and belief that future waves will be milder in strength and will require lesser restrictions on business. If this comes true, a recovery can be expected in FY22.   The pandemic caused disruption in the growth trajectory of 2nd brand, Mirchi Love and 3rd brand, Kool FM. Your management has taken a conservative, yet pragmatic view of the long-term impact of the pandemic on these channels and decided to impair their assets by Rs. 97.5 crores. The management team will continue to strive to return these stations to the earlier growth trajectory.   We gave up some office space, and also renegotiated rates in some places. This led to a saving of 16% during the year.   Due to the new royalty order, costs were down 38% during the year .   License Fees paid to the Govt were down just 8% despite a crash in revenues, because they are governed by a formula which sets the floor.   Marketing costs were pruned by 69% and travel virtually ground to a halt with costs down 90%   Cash and equivalents of Rs. 233 cr.   Substantial revenue from Holding company BCCL. Revenue of Rs. 65-70 cr out of total Rs. 272 cr in FY21.   Total investment of Rs. 19.64 cr in subsidiaries.   During the current year, the holding Company terminated eight lease arrangements pertaining to office premises and one lease arrangement pertaining to transmission facility resulting into de-recognition of related Right of use assets and lease liabilities amounting to 1,323.45 lakhs and 1,650.66 lakhs respectively. The resulting gain on termination amounting to ` 327.21 lakhs has been recorded as Gain on termination of lease.     Industry   Growth in radio penetration continues with 31 private FM broadcasters in 2020, across 111 cities who operates 385 FM radio stations in India .   In addition, the public broadcaster Prasar Bhartis All India Radio service operates 479 stations in 23 languages reaching 92% of the countrys area. India also has 251 operational community radio stations as on September 2020.   As per the Pitch Madison report, the radio industry reported a 44% decline in advertising revenue in FY21 to reach I 1,270 crore. With this drop, Radio has also lost one percent of the market share. This has brought down its share to 2% of the entire Media & Entertainment industry   costs related to payment to the Government of India and its companies proved to be sticky as the Government refused to give any relief. All the Government of India allowed was a 3-month deferment in 1st quarter license fees. Prasar Bharati gave no concessions for their tower rentals. BECIL gave a quarters waiver on monitoring charges, but that was all.   At one time, the FM radio industry was concerned about losing listenership to music apps. However, over time, it has become clear that music apps have created their followership, not taken away FM radio listeners , The 200+ million monthly listeners of radio continue to use the medium, but many of them are now also using music apps. In all, it is estimated that nearly 300 million users exist for music apps. FM radio and music apps have learnt to coexist with several partnerships now starting to form between them. For example, Mirchi has 18 radio stations playing on Gaana, and Gaana spends money on advertising and sponsorship on Mirchi.   Radio broadcasters pay royalties to music companies. The rate of royalty was last set by the Copyright Board (CRB) in August 2010 and the order was valid for 10 years till August 31st, 2020. There was some apprehension amongst radio broadcasters about what the new order would look like.   Broadcasters approached the Intellectual Properties Appellate Board (IPAB), the body that replaced the CRB for such matters, for a new order. The IPAB first restrained music companies from filing infringement suits against broadcasters till the matter was being heard and new orders passed. The new order would be effective from 1st September 2020.   While the earlier royalty was based on revenues (2% of revenues), the new order was based on actual hours of music used by radio stations . The new order prescribed rates by needle hours (actual hours) of music used. It divided the day into prime-time, non-prime time and night time with different rates for each time band .   The new order has been widely welcomed by the radio industry for several reasons.   Firstly, the rates were seen to be broadly fair , protecting the interests of both music companies and broadcasters. The IPAB rejected many of the excessive demands of the music companies. The needle-hour order actually helped the music industry in FY21, earning them more royalties than they would have earned if the revenue based order had continued (since revenues fell in FY21).   Secondly, its an order that applies to all music companies . The earlier order had been challenged by a few companies who managed to get orders in their favor and stay outside its purview, forcing broadcasters to negotiate voluntary licenses with them. Not only did this increase workload for broadcasters, it also subjected them again to the same old extreme demands of these companies.   Thirdly, even though the order is valid only for only one year, the IPAB has clearly said that the basic rate structure would not be disturbed in the future . It thus gives certainty about music royalties in the future.     The IPAB however also entertained a request from the music artists (composers and lyricists), represented by their society, the Intellectual Properties Rights Society (IPRS), to prescribe royalty for them also. Despite protests from broadcasters that various courts had opined that they didnt need to pay IPRS at all, IPAB went ahead and prescribed rates for them. A few days later, the Delhi High Court ruled in one more long pending case that radio broadcasters did not need any license from IPRS, and thus did not have to pay them, thus rendering the IPAB order for IPRS infructuous. Broadcasters have now appealed in the Delhi HC to annul the IPRS part of the IPAB order, while accepting the rates set for music companies.   As per the applicable Frequency Module (FM) broadcasting policy, license fees is recognised in statement of profit and loss at the rate of 4% of gross revenue or minimum fixed fee for the concerned city, whichever is higher. Minimum fixed fee is 2.5% of the Non-Refundable One Time Entry Fee (NOTEF). However, for the first three years of operations in the states of North East (i.e. Assam and Meghalaya) and Jammu & Kashmir the rate of License fee is 2% of Gross Revenue or 1.25% of NOTEF, whichever is higher.

Thanks @chiragjain1976  for initiating a thread about Cosmo Films. I am tracking and holding Cosmo for a year now. From what I have observed, the management is honest, does walk the talk, and since Pankaj Poddar joined, the company seems to be doing all the right things. The dividend yield for last year was around 2.5%. While there is no doubt that the BOPP films consumption is going to grow in India for the next few years, I have two reservations that I closely monitor, it would be much helpful to know your view on it as well.   Right now there is over capacity in the industry as pointed out in one of the posts.   As you rightly pointed out, the cost of raw materials is passed on to the customer. So the drop in prices of crude oil (which is the main raw material for Polypropelene) will reduce the cost of raw materials and this advantage is passed on to the customer and vice versa. But in realty the company performed better when the crude is down for the past three years. This question was asked in their Q1FY17 earnings call. This was the reply from management    So there is no direct correlation with crude?. Answer is no. If you really see the crude has fallen from $120 to $45 which is more than 65-70% reduction. But if you talk about polypropylene prices, the peak polypropylene prices were like $1500-1550 and it is still sitting at $1050 as on date, which is a drop of 30-35%. But on an average what people normally try and predict is that the change in oil price, 50% of that normally gets passed onto polypropylene over a period but the simple reason that polypropylene is not a direct derivative of oil. There are in between 2-3 stages before oil becomes polypropylene. So at a broad level you can say that whatever is the percentage change in oil, polypropylene price may change by half of it but I am not an expert on the matter.  So the falling/increasing prices of crude will definitely affect the cost of raw materials.But how well this cost is cascaded to the customer is still a gray area for me and if the company is in a position to dictate the changes in prices without losing customers as there are also other players like Jindal Poly Films in the industry.

Also management pedigree looks decent. I had evaluated the financials for last 10 years from screener and going through last 2 annual reports; Few Observations:  Sales growth was about 13% CAGR for last 10 years with operating profits in the range of 15% (Mar 08) to 5%(Mar 14). Growth was funded by capacity expansions all along (which should be the case) However, Profits for the last 10 years were not sufficient to fund expansion as Capex in these years was about twice the net profits. Hence debt / equity levels are consistently in the range of 1.6x to 1.0x. ROE good in years when Crude prices are low and had fallen in years when Crude price rises. In the last AR management had hinted that Operating margins are going to be stable at current levels 11%-12% due to cost optimization initiatives undertaken. (Not sure how, as there is cost plus component for its products?) Debt is expected to go up again due to ongoing expansions, as mentioned by the management in the AR. Management is shareholder friendly as always maintained dividend payout of 25% to 30%. Last year they paid highest dividend in their history.  Based on reading so far, it appears that business is competitive, highly dependent on Crude prices for margins and growth is dependent on expansions, which always requires external sources of capital (cant be funded by profits). Management is good aspect of this Company, that could be the reason that it trades at premium as compared to Jindal Polyfilms (Jindal have its own share of Issues). a) Current expansion is in the differentiated product along with more efficient plant. b) Market leader in Value added Products, Focus on increasing revenue from value added products  from 50% to 60%. c) Cost rationalization are already done, although shows management commitment and focus on cost control measures but beyond a point cant add to margins. Not sure how much margin expansion due to above items. Based on above I feels its best to invest in such business when Crude prices are really very high as compared with current scenario, as high crude prices will suppress margins and business may be available at attractive valuations. In a scenario when Crude prices are set to increase, there are chances that margins may decline and consequently the share price.

BOPP and laminations have overcapacity globally and hence  suppliers like cosmos have very little bargaining power    From the annual report - Financial Year 2016 has been one of the best years in the history of Cosmo Films. Consolidated sales stood at Rs. 1,616 Cr representing an 8% growth in sales (not revenues). Furthermore, EBITDA rose approximately 80% to Rs. 197 Cr. During the year, we not only remained focused on driving cost efficiencies across our global operations but also implemented a number of marketing initiatives to increase the sales of higher margin products in specialty films. As a result of these relentless efforts, consolidated profit after tax expanded more than three times to Rs. 96 Cr. Our U.S. operations have also improved from last year as a result of several strategic initiatives taken. Strategic focus area for the company remains value added specialty films and we look forward to increase its share in future. Even though sales volumes (particularly overall specialty sales) grew, revenues declined as benefits from lower raw material prices were passed on to consumers. EBITDA on a consolidated basis is Rs. 196.84 Cr as against Rs. 110.31 Cr in F.Y. 2015, an increase of 78.4%. This includes benefits from a reduction in variable costs through several engineering initiatives. In particular, power cost and freight costs were optimised.

Moreover, mgmt has time and again said that they are increasing focus on specialty segment. This will be the next margin trigger. Along with, the new BOPP line is highly efficient, and would entail savings resulting in better margins. Another important thing is continuous improvement in their US Operations. Here is what mgmt said in August 2016 - \"We had an issue with our Asian subsidiary of Japan and Korea where the currency really went against us, where it was 80 yen to the dollar and it went up as high as 120 yen to the dollar and now it is back to 100 yen to the dollar which gives us a more productive base at least on the Asian side. So I certainly think that this quarter onwards if the currency movement is not as volatile, or we should do better in our Asian subsidiaries. Where the US is concerned, there have been one-off write-offs, there has been one-off some receipts which we got on the customs duty, but I can assure you that the US operation is much more under control. We have revamped the organisation, we have got the right processes in place and I must tell you this today that we are looking to expand US operations at least doubling the revenue in the next couple of years. We are going to invest there, we are going to spend more on processes, but I am fairly confident that in the next 24 months, you will see at least doubling of our revenues which will obviously mean a productive bottomline\".     kb_snn:   Only good thing is it is getting some tax benefits & there is some low cost capacity lined up .

Consolidated Revenue marginally declined by 2% from 1616 cr to 1580 cr. Consolidated PAT for FY17 was 89 cr down from 96 cr in FY16. Standalone PAT increased marginally 3% from 108 cr to 112 cr. Sales from Subsidiaries - US - Sales grew 6% tis eyar to 175cr. Losses reduced to 14 cr from 17 cr in FY16. Japan - Sales grew from 47 cr to 50 c. Though, PAT decreased from 1.42 cr to -.77 cr Korea - Sales reduce from 47 cr to 42 cr. Losses increased from 4 cr to 8 cr. So, subsidiaries are still bleeding big time here. Mgmt says they have attaind breakeven at operational level, but i do not see any improvement.  However, sales volume was up 5%. Consolidated net debt is now 589 cr, Up from 390 cr last year. Net debt to equity is 1.1 This mismatch (higher volumes, revenue decline) was caused due to lower prices of commodity films along with reduced RM prices. Margins were under pressure for most part of the second half (post November) due to demonetization. Lower tax outgo due as the company was able to avail tax deduction on the new investment in plants and machinery allowable under IT Act Investment allowance having an overall impact of 9.8 cr on its tax. Specialty sales of the company grew by 20% YOY. On consolidated basis, one time Forex losses in its Japan subsidiary impacted the bottomline. On domestic front, demonetization impacted it big time.   Company successfully mitigated these negatives to a large extent by increasing the share of value added films (speciality)   Overseas subsidiaries achieved break even at EBIDTA level in Q4 FY 17. Many new products were launched in the specialty segment this year. 10.4 m BOPP line which came online in Feb 2017, will be full operational (ramped up to full capacity by mid FY18). The new installed capacity is expected to add an additional 35-40% production volume in FY18. During FY17, capex done was 221 cr. In FY16, capex done was 84 cr. Also announced 36000 MT BOPET line to be commissioned during Q3 FY19 at a cost of 250 cr (mostly debt). (niche specialty products). Subsidiaries are there in Singapore, US, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Netherlands. Being closer to customer helps fetch better margins. CRM implemented this fiscal. Strong brand visibility initiatives taken during the year to boost exports.Increased from 612 cr to 638 cr. Strong focus on R&D. Special BOPP film for cement bags to increase moisture resistance. R&D expenses grew from 4 cr to 8.4 cr tis year.

Indian packaging industry has registered 15% CAGR growth in last 5 years. Strong momentum is expected to continue. India BOPP capacity is 570k MT, of which 80% is consumed domestically. Significant trends are driving rapid changhe due to increased presence of global multinational companies, consumer brand awareness, products with clean label messaging, increase in per capita income, urbanization, growing number of working women,. e-com per capita plastic consumption in India is 4.3 Kg. China is 6 Kg, Taiwan is 19 Kg. So, huge scope for growth. GST will benefit supply chain efficiency for FMCG companies resulting in cost reduction in terms of transportation. Reduction in cost will make goods cheaper, which is positive for packaging industry.  Key Risks -  RM price volatility - Usually a pass though, but with a lag Forex fluctuation - Hedges, but still a key risk Specialty becoming commodity - Increased competition in specialty segment  Balance Sheet, Working Capital  and Cash Flows -  Balance sheet has become more leverages this year with working capital rising big times by 115 cr (68 cr rise in receivables) + 47 cr rise in inventory. Hence, CFO reduced drastically from 245 cr last year to 30 cr this year.  This is a key point to ask, as to why inventories and receivables have rocketed in FY17. Also, i think debt fueled expansion would lead to problems later on. Currently debt/equity is okaish at 1.1, but would have liked them to generate better cash flows to fuel growth.

With Spec Chem being the flavor of the season, decided to have a in-depth look at this one to find if its a red herring just riding the wave, or if it can deliver true value over long term. Company Background   Incorporated as Gujarat Quinone Private Limited at Vadodara, Gujarat on 15 Dec 1988. Current promotors incorporated Chemcon Engineers Pvt Ltd in April 1996. They acquired 100% in Gujarat Quinone and merged the 2 companies and renamed entity as Chemcon Speciality Chemicals (CSCL)   CSCL is engaged in the business of manufacturing, marketing and supplying of the Pharmaceutical Chemicals and the Oilwell Completion Chemicals.   CSCL is an ISO 9001:2015 certified company. Its manufacturing plant is located in Manjusar, near Vadodara.   Products & Applications   CSCL product portfolio consists of Pharmaceutical Chemicals, mainly HMDS & its ancillary chemicals and CMIC   Oilwell Completion Chemicals, namely Calcium Bromide (solution and powder), Zinc Bromide (solution) and Sodium Bromide (solution and powder)   HMDS is important intermediates for  API of life saving Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs used to treat HIV / AIDS and Direct Antiviral Action (DAA) drugs for Hepatitis B & C   HMDS is also an key intermediate for 2nd Gen Cephalosporin antibiotics which are used to treat variety of conditions in Bronchitis, Ear infections, Skin infections, bacterial infections, and infections of ear, lung, throat and urinary tract   Similarly, CMIC too is an critical intermediate for API of HIV / Hepatitis B & C drugs   Its Bromide family of Oil well chemicals are used preparation of Oil wells during oil & gas exploration   Business Analysis Since the company is in listing process right now, financial data is available only for limited period of FY17, FY18 and FY19 in DRHP document.   Although CSCL has a limited basket of products, it seems to be well positioned in the market for these products.   In HMDC, it is the ONLY manufacturer in India, and the 8th largest producer in the world, as of FY18   For CMIC, it is the LARGEST in India, and the 2nd LARGEST producer in the world   Thus, it has been very successful establish itself within its niche, within a relatively short period of time   Industry-wise Revenue   As of FY19, Pharma contributes almost 2/3 of the revenue and remaining 1/3 is contributed by Oil Well Completion Chemicals business   A minuscule part of revenue comes from other industries such as semi-conductor and rubber. A very small amount of revenue comes from services       Segment % of FY 19 Revenue % of FY 18 Revenue % of FY 17 Revenue     Pharma Chemicals 62.99% 61.97% 46.89%   Oil Well Chemicals 35.42% 35.86% 50.53%   Others 1.59% 2.17% 2.58%    Product-wise Revenue   As of FY 19, almost 40% of its revenue comes from its biggest product, HMDS   Bromide family of products contribute about 35%   CMIC contributes about 15.65% revenue   Domestic Vs Export Revenue   Revenue from domestic sales in FY19 is 196 Cr (64.67%), up from 24.2 Cr in FY17 (26.95%)   Revenue from exports in FY19 is seen at 98 Cr (32.22%), up from 58.5 Cr in Fy17 (65.08%)   Between FY17 and FY19, CSCL has demonstrated a very strong growth in both domestic as well as exports sales   While its total revenue has grown to almost 4 times in these 2 years,  its export sales have grown to over 1.5  times, while the domestic sales have grown almost by a massive 8 times in this  short period   Market Share   CSCL is Indias only HMDS manufacturer, and 8th largest globally.  It has a global market share of 5.61% in HMDS. Its India market share in HMDS is 47.9%   It is also Indias top manufacturer of CMIC, and 2nd biggest globally. It has a global market share of 28% and domestic market share of 50.4%   In Oil well chemicals (Bromides), its market share is very small, 2.66%, though it is 6th largest manufacturer of such chemicals in the world. What is commendable though, is that till year 2013, CSCL did not even make these products, so it has done relatively very well to get this market share in a short span of 7 years.   Capacity & Utilization   CSCL has a total installed volumetric capacity of 236 KL. These are spread across 6 manufacturing plans at their single manufacturing site in Vadodara   Of the 6 plans, 1 is dedicated to making HMDS, 2 are for CMIC, 2 are for Oil Well Chemicals. One plant for HMDS was damaged in fire accident in 2018, and they are rebuilding it.   Total installed capacity is at 2400 MT for HMDS, 1800 MT for CMIC and 14,400 MT for Bromides solution and 600 MT for Bromides powder.   Current utilization (FY19) for HMDS is 93%, for CMIC is at 95% and for Bromides is at 57%   As per plan, IPO proceeds (fresh sale of 165 Cr) will be utilised for CAPEX for 3 new plants (46 Cr), shared infrastructure  and Working capital (90 Cr)   All the 3 new plants will be dedicated to making of pharma chemicals i.e. HMDS & CMIC   The new plants will add new volumetric capacity of 376 KL. Along with restoration of plant lost in fire incident, the total capacity will rise to about 625 KL, more than doubling from current installed capacity.   Growth Runway   As per Frost & sullivan report, HMDS demand in India is projected to grow at CAGR of 5.6% in next 3 years. India is currently net importer of HMDS, with 52% of its demand in 2018 met by imports, mainly from China. Chemcon is the only HMDS manufacturer in India. Hence, by substituting imports and catering to Indias HMDS market, Chemcon has an opportunity to grow at a CAGR of ~20% between 2018 and 2023 in the HMDS Segment.   India and China are the ONLY 2 countries in the world to make CMIC. India has 45% market share, and China has 55% market share of global production.   India has the largest demand for CMIC, with 65% of global consumption. This demand is growing very fast. CMIC is critical input for HIV / Hepatitis B life-saving drugs. Demand for these drugs has been rising due to lowing prices and rising demand for better healthcare.   As per Frost & Sullivan report, global demand for CMIC is predicted to grow at CAGR of 12.5% between 2018 and 2023, with demand in India expected to grow at 14% CAGR in the same period. Currently, India is a net importer of CMIC, with 50% of its demand being met through imports from China.   Chemcon being leading producer of CMIC in India, is well positioned to substitute imports from China and hence has an opportunity to grow at a CAGR of more than 25% in CMIC segment between 2018 and 2023.   With planned CAPEX will double the capacity in lucrative pharma chemicals (HMDS, CMIC). Thus,  post-expansion, CSCL will be in great position to grow its revenue by meeting the rising demand of HMDS and CMIC   If CSCL is able to achieve its expected growth CAGR of ~20% over next 3 years in HMDS & CMIC segment (currently 62%+ of its revenue ~200 Cr), it can easily double its revenue from the pharma segment in this period, to about 400 Cr   Competitors   In HMDS, its leading competitors are Dow Chemicals (18.19% global market share), Xingyaqian Silicon (China, 20.68% market share), Zheijiang Sorbo (China, 10.22% share), Shin-Etsu (Japan, 10.44% share).   In CMIC segment, Shanghai Twisun leads with a global market share of 33.46%, followed by Chemcon, trailed by Anshul Speciality (India, 11.26% global share) and Inner Mongolia Saintchem at 14.8% share.   In Oil Well Chemicals segment, its biggest competitors are Israel Chemicals Limited, Albermarle, LANEXESS, TETRA and PPC.   However, since it has no competition from any of the global majors in India, it maintains massive market share in domestic markets (HMDS 47%, CMIC 50%), while rest of demand is met through imports.   With domestic demand expected to grow at healthy pace in both HMDS and CMIC, CSCL can continue to expand at a much faster pace by substituting imports   Competitive Moat   Substantial market presence in HMDS segment. Indias only producer of HMDS and 8th largest in the world   Indias largest and 2nd largest globally, with a dominant global market share of 28%   Speciality Chemicals industry has high barrier to entry due to several reasons     a.	Involvement of complex chemistry in manufacture of products, which are difficult to commercialize on a large scale   b.	Long gestation period to be enlisted as a supplier with the reputed customers of Pharma industry and Global chemical groups   Industry is highly knowledge intensive   Given the nature of the end application of products, the processes and products are subject to and measured against high quality standards and very stringent impurity specifications. These are extremely difficult to achieve for new entrants   Since the intermediates are used in API manufacturing, reworking of regulatory approvals required by them on change of suppliers is very time consuming and costly, resulting in customer sticking to proven suppliers, thus making it very difficult for new players to enter   Some of the products used in manufacturing of Speciality chemicals are corrosive and toxic, and handing these materials requires a very high degree of technical skill and expertise, the operations involving these have to be undertaken by well trained and experienced personnel, which is not easy to obtain.    Obtaining environmental clearances from government agencies to set up and expand capacities for manufacturing these chemicals is time-consuming and difficult process. Even for established players, obtaining permission often proves to be elusive. New players thus find it very difficult to get a foot-hold  Financials   Revenue is growing at a break-neck pace, rising almost 4x between 2017 and FY2019, at a CAGR of 83.95%, up from 89.8 Cr in Fy17 to 304 Cr in Fy19. DRHP document does not contain financials of FY20, but from unconfirmed data available on various sites, the revenue for Fy20 has fallen by about 10% to 266 Cr, even though PAT has improved to 48.8 Cr in FY20, compared to 43.08 Cr in Fy 19.   EBIDTA in the same period (FY17 - FY19) has grown from 86.6 million to 679.21 million at a CAGR of 180.06%. PAT has jumped from 28.24 million in FY17 to 430.41 million in FY19, growing at CAGR of 290.39%   Decent balance sheet, with negligible debt and leverage. Inventory levels have shot up, but given the explosive growth in sales in last 2 years, its in line. Similarly receivables have shot up almost doubling over last 1 year, but given that revenue has doubled too.   RoE and RoCE for FY19 are seen at 44.94% and 43.37%   Receivable days are pretty high at 106 days, almost doubling from 56 days seen in previous year. This is clearly a concern.   Cash flow from operations has declined slightly to 113.71 million, down from 139.97 in FY18. Decline has mainly been due to steep rise in Inventories and trade receivables   Promotors   Promoters of the CSCL are Kamalkumar Rajendra Aggarwal, Navdeep Naresh Goyal and Shubharangana Goyal.  Promotor group consists of another 15+ names in what looks like extended family / associates   The promotors have a stake in another listed company in India - Overseas Synthetics Ltd, and several other unlisted ventures, 3 of which qualify by SEBIs definition as Group companies.   All the 3 unlisted companies have very ordinary performance. One (dealing in industrial linings) has a revenue of 19 Cr and meagre PAT of 0.5 Cr, another one (dealing in technical textiles) has a revenue of 6 cr with a profit of 0.8 Cr. Third one (dealing in real estate), has zero sales and a small loss of 0.3 Cr. The listed entity Overseas Synthetics, has had zero sales for the last 4 years, and practically nothing for past 10 years!!   There are some negative observations relating to these companies.  In SILPL, it has granted unsecured loans to another promoter venture without clarity of interest rate and repayment terms. In case of Supertech Fabrics, there is dispute / law suit contending the purchase of a land parcel. In Kana Real Estate, the networth of the company has been fully eroded.   There are couple of additional significant Red Flags about the promotors   Kamalkumar Rajendra Aggarwal, Shubharangana Goyal and Navdeep Naresh Goyal and certain members of the Promoter Group, namely, Naresh Vijaykumar Goyal and Minal Kamal Aggarwal (collectively, the PG OSL Shareholders), have filed a settlement application dated March 10, 2019 with SEBI in relation to their inadvertent failure to make certain disclosures required under the Takeover Regulations and the SEBI Insider Trading Regulations in relation to their holdings in Overseas Synthetics Limited (OSL), a company listed on BSE Limited, which is a member of the Promoter Group.   Further, pursuant to a criminal complaint (Complaint) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (Jaipur) (CBI), the CBI Special Court, Jaipur (CBI Court), vide an order dated December 24, 2018 (CBI Court Order), has convicted and sentenced inter alia a member of the Promoter Group, Naresh Vijaykumar Goyal (in his capacity as a director of Super Scientific Works Private Limited) to (i) rigorous imprisonment for two years with a fine of 10,000 for commission of offences under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860; and (ii) rigorous imprisonment for three years and fine of  20,000 each for commission of offences under Section 13(1)(d)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988   So, other than the success of CSCL itself, the track record of the promoters across their other ventures is not too flattering, and can be termed as moderate at best. Probably, the presence of 2 non-promoter, whole-time Directors contributes immensely to the success of CSCL over last 20 years. Mr Himanshu Purohit, who holds a masters degree in inorganic chemistry, has been with the company for last 20 years, and is currently Director  Production, taking care of critical functions such as Product Development, Production, and Material management. Similarly, Mr Rajesh Gandhi, CFO and Whole-time director, has been with the company for 20 years, and is in charge of key functions such as Finance & accounting, Export-Import, Compliance etc. Together, they seem to have played a key role in the success of CSCL.   Risks   Promotor Risk - With the red flags noted above, it remains to be seen whether the promotors are clean and also given the performance of other group companies, CSCL remains the only exception which is successful.   Raw material import risk: CSCL is heavily dependent on imports for its raw materials. As of FY19, 50.89% of companys raw materials were imported. This exposes it to cost escalations due to currency exchange fluctuations.  Also, a large part of its raw materials are sourced from china. Given the recent escalations in border dispute between India and China, any trade relationship breakdown / embargo between the two countries will have a big material impact on revenue and profitability of CSCL.   Product Concentration Risk : As of now, 40% of CSCLs revenue comes from one product  HMDS, used mainly for its applications in pharmaceutical industry. Revenue of CSCL depends on success of its customers end-products. Any change in that will have a very big impact on CSCLs revenue and profitability.   Industry Concentration Risk : CSCL relies on Pharma and Oil and Gas Exploration industry for almost all of its revenue. Any down-cycle or headwinds experienced by these industries will have a very massive impact on CSCLs revenue and profitability.   Customer Concentration Risk: As we have already seen earlier in this analysis, CSCL has massive dependence on its top 5 and top 10 customers. Any negative turn in relationship with  any of these customers will have an immediate large impact on revenue and profit of CSCL.   Regulatory / Environmental Clearance Risk :  Obtaining environmental clearance in India is difficult. Any delays / problems in getting clearance for capacity expansion can have a direct and material impact on the growth and financial performance of CSCL.   Execution Risk : If CSCL fails to execute on its strategy, failing to utilise the growth potential, it may have a big impact on its financials.   Market Risk : If the growth in demand for CSCLs customers end products does not rise as expected, it would have a significant impact on financial performance of CSCL.   Conclusion   Just looking at the business in isolation, CSCL has found itself a very profitable and unique niche. With critical end-use of its products and rising demand, it looks to be on a unhindered growth path for the next 2-3 years. It has got itself in leadership position in its product segment within India and has made an impact globally as well.   Growth Opportunity  With projections from Frost & Sullivan report indicating strong growth for its products in next 3 years, CSCL finds itself in an exciting space. Barring some extreme internal mismanagement or an external black swan event, it looks to be on track to achieve significant growth and leverage on the growth opportunity available to it.   Promotor / Management Quality : CSCL Promotor quality is not top-notch, with several of their side ventures not being successful. Presence of couple of red flags (indicated in this report earlier) does not inspire confidence either. Though they have been in this domain for many years, they have not demonstrated innovation. Hopefully, the professional executives in the management team continue to drive the company to success, as they have done in recent past.   Drop in Fy20 revenue, though small (about 10%), rising inventory days, rising receivable days etc are concerns, so those have to be closely monitored.   Basis of current valuation assigned for IPO, at Rs 340, the stock is fairly valued at PE of 22.15 on trailing FY20  earnings. Given that other peers in Spec Chem space are commanding richer multiples in excess of 30, and also given the current IPO frenzy, this is likely to see good listing gains.   I plan to take a very small tracking position, and will watch it closely to see how its plays out, especially given the growth potential of the products and the less than inspiring management.

Here are few observations image884786 398 KB   PPE has gone up from 47.5 Cr to 62 Cr, a rise of about 15 crores. Not sure what this is and where has it been spent. Cash flow statement validates the expenditure, but there are no specific details. Since the company got listed recently, there is no annual report of previous year to validate this from.   Receivables are continuously mounting year after year, and now stand at 110 crores. Similar trend is seen in the past years too. Corresponding figures for FY17, FY18, FY19 and FY 20 are 22 Cr, 29 Cr, 64 Cr and 89 Cr respectively. Between FY17 to FY19, there was an explosive growth, where sales grew from 89 Cr in FY17 to 304 Cr in FY19, so there was some justification for receivables to grow.  FY20 sales were down by about 14% to 262 Cr. H1 FY21 sales stand at 107 crores, compared to 154 Cr in H1 FY20, down by over 31%. When seen in this context especially, the steep increase in receivables (23.6%) in a span of 6 months is alarming.   Just to put the intensity of receivables in perspective - At 110 Cr, its practically at 42% of FY20 sales of 262 Cr. Worse still, for the current year,  it exceeds the H1 revenue of 107 Cr!!   Though the receivables are rapidly going up, the payables are moving in the opposite trend. We see a reduction in payables from 25 Cr in Mar 2020 to 19 Cr in Sep 2020. So while company is increasing its receivables rapidly, its reducing its payables rapidly too. This will surely mean a marked increase in working capital requirements.   Debt stays steady at around 14 Cr, reducing marginally in last 6 months.   Cash & Cash Equivalent have increased from 1.07 Cr to 113.14 Cr.  Similarly the next item, bank balances too shows a sharp jump from 13 Cr to 216 Cr.  These spikes are primarily due to the IPO which company floated in last week of September 2020. The IPO collected about 318 Cr, of which promoters offloaded shares worth 153 Cr through OFS component, while there was a fresh issue of 165 Cr. So about 153 crores collected on behalf of the promoters OFS sale. Of remaining, 165 crores is to be utilized as proceeds from IPO. Of this, companys plan is to utilize about 45 cr for expanding capacity, and about 90 Cr for working capital, and the remaining for other corporate purposes. The company got listed only on 1st October, hence the funds show up on the companys books as of 30 Sep 2020.   image1157541 352 KB   Revenue in Q2 stood at 61.53 Cr compared to 45.66 Cr in Q1 FY21. Optically, this looks good QoQ, but when compared YoY, it shows a decline of 5.8%. If we compare H1 FY21 to H1 FY20, decline is even more stark, with revenue falling by 30.6%. Company says that decline is due to disruption of operations due to Covid-19 pandemic. While it may be true to certain extent, we do see that most other spec chem companies have shown far more resilient revenues, even though they were hit by the same pandemic.   Another worrying trend seen in Q2 FY21 P&L is the steep rise in COGS. In Q2 FY20, the COGS was 29.53 Cr on a revenue of 65 Cr, where as the COGS seen in Q2 FY21 is 39 Cr on a revenue of 61.53 Cr. There is a big spike in COGS to the extent of almost 33% YoY. ChemCon has 2 main products HMDS and CMIC. The primary raw materials for these products is TMCS (Trimethlychlorosilane) and MCF (MethylChloroFormate) respectively. It would be worthwhile to check the price trend of these in international markets in 2020 to assess if this is truly due to RM cost going up, or due to some other inefficiencies in operations.   It must be noted here that Chemcon does not have any long-term purchase contracts with its suppliers, so any spike in prices of raw materials will immediately translate in higher costs for them. Also, it does not have long term supply contracts with its customers, so it may or may not be able to increase prices to its customers. In short, they will experience spikes in margins and profitability if the RM prices fluctuate.   PBT for Q2 FY21 stands at 20.89 Cr compared to 17.95 Cr in Q2 FY20. This is an optical play. How can PBT increase despite sharp increase in prices of raw materials? Its because there has been a sharp reduction in inventory to the tune of 13.29 crores, which boosts the PBT and the PAT.   PAT comes in  at 15.58 Cr compared to 13.62 Cr in Q2 FY 20. The big change in inventory perks up the PAT, and it also perks up the EPS, which stands at Rs 4.89 for the quarter compared to Rs 4.29 for the same quarter in the previous year.   If the company picks up pace in H2, theoretically, it can still make up for lost ground. But it looks very unlikely that they will see any growth compared to last years revenue. At best, they may end up somewhere close to last years revenue, which of course will be considered below par, given the rich valuations that the company still commands, despite the rapid fall in share prices since the listing day.   image883823 433 KB   Cash Flow statement confirms the massive change in receivables to the tune of 21 crores. It also confirms the change in payables. There is also large reduction in current financial assets, about 17.4 Crores.   CFO has dipped to a mere 2.12 Crores, compared to a healthy 24 Crores from previous year. Its a massive drop. Almost all of the drop can be attributed to the 21 crore increase in receivables. That makes receivable a must watch figure in the next couple of quarters.   Lastly, we also see the IPO proceeds in CFF as well as 153 Cr received on behalf of the promoters OFS.   With this, its very important to watch out for the following in the next 2 quarters, and beyond that too  Whether the sales recover or does the damp performance continue? Does the margin pressure continue due to higher raw material prices? Receivables must come down to more realistic levels Cash flow recover to healthy levels or not  If these do not improve in next couple of quarters, this could be negative for the company.

Revenue shows a growth of about 7% QoQ basis and about 16% on YoY basis. Though one should look at this growth in the larger context that revenue in FY20 had shown a decline of about 10+% on annual basis.   If one factors in, the disappointing numbers of Q1 and Q2 FY21, then despite this small rise in Q3, overall unless it delivers outstanding Q4 topline, there is a very realistic possibility that the full FY21 revenue may just be only marginally better than FY20 annual topline. If the revenue remains flat, that will mark 2 years in a row where the company will be struggling for growth, which does not bode well for a company that enjoys virtual monopoly in India in its leading products.   One positive factor is that COGS has come down sharply, suggesting drop in RM prices and easing pressure on margins. As stated in my post on Q2 results, in the absence of long term contracts with its RM suppliers as well as its customers, company will always be exposed to RM price fluctuations and thus will suffer from margin volatility. They must look to mitigate this in the long term interest of the company.   This quarter has been used to restore part of the inventory which was utilised in the previous quarter.   image835157 49.2 KB   One of the main purpose of the IPO was to raise funds for capacity expansion. There seems to be very slow progress on this front. Of 41 cr earmarked for the CAPEX, only about 4 crores or roughly about 10% have been utilised in the 3 months since the IPO.  Please note that the company does not need to spend any money on land, as the plants are to be setup on their existing site. So the planned CAPEX is only for civil and machinery / plant setup.  Additionally, the company had already obtained quotations for Civil work, plant / machinery / equipment in late 2019, from leading vendors.  Especially within this context, I think the progress appears extremely slow. Though its not clear what their implementation timelines are, if there is any delay it could lead to cost over-runs and will delay the revenue growth even further.   As per the data shared by the company, they are running at near peak installed capacity utilisation for their 2 leading products (93% for HMDS & 95% for CMIC). One of their HMDS plant was damaged in fire accident in FY 2018. The fact that one of your key product plants gets destroyed in fire, and you delay rebuilding it for almost 3 years this itself raises a concern about the management priorities. Even if it takes 12 to 18 months for settling insurance claims, the damaged plant could have been rebuilt in 3 years. Further, slow implementation of the expansion project, especially with funds lying in the bank is an even bigger concern.  Seen in the context that the revenue growth had been stuttering at best in past 2 fiscals, you wonder about the mechanics of the decision making.   Since balance sheet data is not available, not sure if the situation has improved on the abnormally high receivables levels seen in Q2. Similarly, cash flow trend remains to be seen.   So in summary, continuing from the questions raised in my post on Q2 results With this, its very important to watch out for the following in the next 2 quarters, and beyond that too   Whether the sales recover or does the damp performance continue?   Revenue shows a decent improvement. Lets see how the trend continues in next quarter.   Does the margin pressure continue due to higher raw material prices?   Positively, the COGS shows a downward trend, helping shore up the margins. This however, needs long-term mitigation through long-term purchase contracts with vendors.   Receivables must come down to more realistic levels   In absence of Balance sheet data, remains to be seen.   Cash flow recover to healthy levels or not   Remains to be seen.

Other than COGS, most of the expenses are more or less flattish, hence on a higher revenue and lower COGS, net profit could have been higher, but for the change in inventory. The problem however is in the long run every upward swing in RM prices will squeeze the margins for them, due to the fact that neither they have long term procurement agreement with their vendors, nor do they have significant pricing power with their customers.  For them to have predictability and stability in margins, they need have a mitigation strategy in place. The reason I stress more about revenue growth for Chemcon is because almost 2/3 of their revenue comes from Pharma industry and they have grown significantly in last 3 years prior to IPO based on pharma products. Given the world we have seen in last year, all strong pharma companies have grown much faster than their past averages. So why not Chemcon? ARV products have been a raging success for several companies like Laurus Labs, Hetero, Aurobindo, and its important to note that all of them are Chemcons customers. So the same product category is driving explosive growth for Laurus / Hetero but not for Chemcon? I will be honest to say that my knowledge in this sector is very limited, so the reasons may be very obvious to people who know, but not to me.

That will be taking a very narrow view of the given data.  Let me elaborate on this, and for this I will paste some lines from my very first post on this thread.   As per Frost & sullivan report, HMDS demand in India is projected to grow at CAGR of 5.6% in next 3 years. India is currently net importer of HMDS, with 52% of its demand in 2018 met by imports, mainly from China. Chemcon is the only HMDS manufacturer in India. Hence, by substituting imports and catering to Indias HMDS market, Chemcon has an opportunity to grow at a CAGR of ~20% between 2018 and 2023 in the HMDS Segment.       India and China are the ONLY 2 countries in the world to make CMIC. India has 45% market share, and China has 55% market share of global production.      India has the largest demand for CMIC, with 65% of global consumption. This demand is growing very fast. CMIC is critical input for HIV / Hepatitis B life-saving drugs.     As per Frost & Sullivan report, global demand for CMIC is predicted to grow at CAGR of 12.5% between 2018 and 2023, with demand in India expected to grow at 14% CAGR in the same period. Currently, India is a net importer of CMIC, with 50% of its demand being met through imports from China.    Please refer to the above points There is strong growth projected in these products, not just in India but globally too. Now, its possible that projection for growth could go totally wrong, so lets just ignore them for now In both these products, India is a net importer by a massive margin. This despite Chemcon being Indias ONLY producer of HMDS and 8th largest globally and Indias largest producer of CMIC and 2nd largest globally.  Given its market leadership position within India, and given all the anti-china rhetoric in recent past (and the china + 1 strategy) expanding market share aggressively through import substitution should be well within its reach. What stops it? Current capacity utilization.  Capacity utilization in FY19 for HMDS is 93%, for CMIC is at 95% and for Bromides is at 57%. If this data is true, then capacity expansion is the only logical way ahead. Besides, the IPO event is barely 4 months old so if the company did not have plans to expand, why would it launch an IPO with one of the stated objectives for fund raise being capacity expansion?

The Company paid back a significant portion of its highcost debt worth C905 million ahead of the repayment schedule. Furthermore, the Company stands to benefit from the Interest Equalisation Scheme promoted by the Central Government to support exporters.

Below are the positive, risks and a few questions- Positives  Increase in home textiles business. While the sales may not grow much going forward as more yarn is used internally, the margins will improve materially. The margins for yarn move between 12-18%, 22-24% for terry towel and 24-28% for bed linen. Given below is the EBITDA for the segment. Q317 was impacted by increasing cotton prices. The bed linen capacity has increased from 10% on q1 17 to 30% in q3 17. The company expects 40% utilization this year. Terry towel capacity utilizatoin is 50% post expansion in 2015 and is expected to increase to 65% by FY 18. At optimum utilization the company can do 5000 cr of revenue vs 3600 cr TTM which leaves them with some room to grow     Paper segment has witnessed increase in realizations as the share of copier branded segment has increased. They have the highest margins in the industry. The company seems to have increased prices despite reduction in raw material (wheat straw) prices. Most of the improvement in profitability has come from paper. The impact can be seen below     The company has been pre paying its high cost debt and now 75% of the debt on the BS is under TUF. As on September 2016 the outstanding net debt was 2520 cr and the company is scheduled to pay 80-100 cr for the next 8 quarters. The net debt to equity has gone down from 3,1 in 2013 to 1.4 in December 2016   The company revisited its capex plans on power plant and yarn modernization which shows their intent on reducing debt and increasing ROCE   . The company has no capex plans as of now and will only spend maintenance capex of 50 cr going forward. The management expects to generate 400 cr of cash after meeting debt payments. The company has also started paying dividends.   Negatives  High volatility in cotton and inability to pass on price increases to customers Management using warrants to increase equity stake in the past. However the management has assured of no dilution going forward. Two completely unrelated businesses housed under one entity. Demerger can unlock value. Promoter has political background.  Questions   Does being fully integrated help companies like Trident in reducing the impact of increasing cotton prices? A preliminary look at Indocount margins recently shows that the reduction in margins is higher vis a vis Trident due to increasing cotton candy prices   Can we track cotton candy prices from any source?   The company is currently doing 18% EBITDA margin in textile. This is at 40% bed linen and 50% capacity utilization. The company expects revenue of 5000cr at optimum utilization from both these segments. Then why is it that the management is guiding 18% EBITDA margin despite significant scope of improvement due to shift to high margin and operating leverage? The peers are doing far higher margins - even the ones who are fully integrated   All in all, this does not seem to be a bad bet.  Assuming the company reaches its target of 5000cr and does 18% EBITDA in textiles and does 900 cr in paper with normalized margin of 30% - EBITDA in 2019 would be around 1200 cr. Using 8 ev/ebitda multiple and assuming a debt of 1500 cr by 2019 the equity valued comes out to be around 7800/7900 cr as compared to the current market cap of 4500 cr  an upside of approx. 70%. Normally I would look for higher upside bets but in this market with low valuation comfort in omost of the stocks, this doesnt seem too bad. Disc.

Earlier, they were under other operating income, so werent visible like now.  You are right about the lower margins for q4 (16%)slide from 20%. Reasons were considerable inr appreciation, expensive cotton. Going forward, management has guided for 18-22% EBIDTA margins for next 2 years. Mgmt said cotton prices are going to moderate going forward due to higher acreage. Another point which will be aiding margins in 2018 is higher bed linen component in the overall mix and better product mix within bed linen segment to value added products. Rebate of State Levies (ROSL) is also going to improve margins for exports division by 2 - 2.5% for home textile exporters). Another factor in margin improvement will be more captive yarn consumption. So overall, net effect on EBIDTA margins will be positive going forward. Paper - He said there were fewer number of days in q4 (if you look sequentially), and plant was closed for maintenance for some time in q4, so effected paper segment. Going forward, paper production and utilization would improve sequentially. Bed linen division should break even in q218. (at around 40% utilisation). Currently operating at ~29%. In Q4, utilization per segment Yarn - 96% Bath - 54% Paper - 88% Bed - 29% in 2018, target is to improve bath segment utilization by 55-60% and bed segment by 40-50% 4-5 month hedging policy. I think 40% is covered. Net debt reduced from 3420 cr to 2714 cr by March \'17. Of this, around 1500 cr is at 3%. Average interest rate is 4%, which will go down due to -  Debt repayment (300-400 cr for this fiscal). Raising money through NCD/CP to retire higher cost debt earlier than scheduled. Approvals are in place.  No capex planned for next 2-3 years. Depends on utilization levels. Said, once they attain 70% utilization, they will think of any further capex. Regarding yarn segment, no capex planned (usual 50-100 cr will be spent this year to clear bottlenecks). Paper division, pondering upon 100-200 cr capex which will increase capacity by 15-20%. Nothing concrete yet. Added one big customer. Impact would be visible from June. Growth in US/Europe is around 3-4% pa. Risks -  Currency fluctuation (INR appreciation) Higher cotton prices (forms 50% of the costs)  Trying to mitigate the currency risks by hedging receivables. New contracts are negotiated based on current currency and cotton prices. Overall, in yarn there is a lag of 40-45 days to pass on the prices, and in bed/bath, 90-135 days. Being vertically integrated, they are able to moderate any drastic price impacts much better than other players. What i like about Trident is that they are sort of walking the talk as far as improving the Balance Sheet is concerned. They are continuously adding new customers to fill in their capacity. Management is prudent enough to negotiate and fill the capacity by lowering margins upfront and then gradually work up the ladder on the margin front. Indian textile industry is still much more competitive than Chinese and others due to various factors discussed already on the forum. I am hopeful of them maintaining 15-20% growth on this higher base for next few years. At 11.5 p/e trailing, with Free cash flows close to 750 cr per annum, they will be able to clear the debt as planned, which will result in better net margins.

It took me almost a week to get some perspective out of all the data and estimates that were shared in them. I believe that is because I am a total novice in this (this is only the second company ever on which I have done any sort of serious research). Being from non-commerce background doesnt do any favour either. But hopefully I will get better in future. From what I understood, this particular company is a complete utilization play we have in our hand here. They have just completed their massive expansion plan and their capacity in the bath linen (terry towel etc) segment is the highest among industry peers (25% greater than their closest peer Welspun) and their facilities in both bath and bed linen have full vertical integration. According to the reports, the expansions were done by the management in order to make the company future ready, as the home textile market is expected to grow at a good pace in the next few years both globally and in the domestic arena. However, I thought that having capacity is one thing, but utilizing it is a different thing altogether and thats where I am concerned about, because their current utilization is around 45% (before the capex it was 74%). I guess this is where experience comes into play. Maybe someone who has seen utilization plays like these in the years past play out would have been in a much better position to judge the potential here than I am. But one thing which I clearly understood is that, to increase the utilization the company will need to expand their client base and acquire more orders. Maybe they can do that, maybe not. I guess thats what we are betting for here. However, I learned that in FY18 so far Trident has already acquired 10 clients which includes large replenishment clients like IKEA and Amazon. So that is a good news. I have been also reading about the management and it looked to me that the board has a good lot of people and they are pretty open with the shareholders about their plans etc as well. Also there are a lot of small pointers here and there in those reports which suggested that the management is fairly reliable. Now about valuation, Edelweiss has mentioned that they have started coverage from Rs. 85 and in a recent report from CRISIL the fair value is mentioned as Rs. 93 and in the Motilal Oswal report they are saying that the fair value is around 90, taking 8x of FY19E PE. In another website I saw it is Rs. 104. So looks like the fair value is between Rs. 85-95. Unfortunately I have to rely on these because I am not someone who can do DCF etc and the CMP is 100, so its slightly overvalued per se at the moment. This is pretty strange as well, in a market like we have today, a stock is available near its fair value. Dont know how that happened. At the moment my conviction about the stock is at best medium and since the valuation is reasonable (if the reports are to be believed), 5% is what I am planning to invest in it (I am following the capital allocation framework suggested by Donald Francis in the forum). I have currently invested 1%, waiting for the price to come down. Disc - As mentioned I have invested a small amount mainly for tracking purpose.

Stronger rupee and higher raw material prices due to unavailability of quality cotton continue to remain key headwinds for the Textile Industry. Bed and bath   Have been able to sustain our realization in Bed & Bath Linen business and we sense that de-stocking is a temporary phenomenon and hope to see volume growth in coming quarters (as US consumer demand is in tact).   For FY19 we have already given the utilization guidance for our bed linen segment (50-60%) for the entire year; for towel, we expect double-digit kind of volume growth.   If towel volumes are not good, we have the flexibility to sell more yarn outside.   We are offsetting the degrowth by having a better volume in our yarn business so that is a kind of flexibility we have in terms of our textile within the segments. So as soon as the towel utilization improve, our captive consumption (which is currently ~33%) will improve and that will have a better margin on maybe on an overall sales basis, the growth will be there. In terms of volumes, we will get a better margin.   Bath Linen 9Maverage Capacity Utilization stood at 45% and Bed Linen capacity utilization over 9M period stood at 42%. We foresee that volume should be back in the ongoing quarter and will be able to clock about 50%capacity utilization in both Bath & Bed Linen.   945 crores / 15.3% EBITDA.   Bed linen segment is now EBITDA break-even. Bed linen at full utilization can do 1000 Cr.   We had achieved a highest utilization of 54% in towel business in Q4FY2017. It was ~51% in Q1 and now in Q2 and Q3 is the major impact when the utilizations came down to 42%, 43%.   Towel has degrown ~11% in this qtr yoy, while sheeting has registered ~62% volume growth. Towel realization was ~3% higher and sheeting realization was ~20% higher. This 20% higher realization is sheeting is due to moving from greige to processing.   Domestic Home Textile  Has seen more than 47% revenue growth yoy over 9M period compared to 9M FY 17. We will emerge not only as a leading global player in Bed and Bath Linen segment but will also capitalize on the growing opportunities in domestic market. This currently forms 7-9% of the overall business.  Yarn   Arrival of Cotton this season was decent and price was down ~15% compared to last season. But due to quality issues the cotton prices started going up during December and currently the price is almost up 10% from bottom.   9M average capacity utilization stood at 95%. No capex planned as of now.   Paper   Revenue (223cr) remained flat Y-o-Y despite 7% increase in sales volume majorly due to change in product mix. Copier paper sales for 9M stood 48% vis--vis 52% for FY17. 9M average capacity utilization stood at 89%.   EBITDA Margin stood at 39%. 36% to 40% margin is sustainable.   Wheat straw is the basic raw material; H1 is the season for this RM (cheaper) and H2 is off season (costlier).   Debt   During the 9MFY18, Long Term Debt have been reduced by 385 Cr to 1663 Cr; Interest Cost has been reduced ~17% in 9MFY18 to INR 90.5 Cr.   Ahead of this schedule in terms of our debt repayment.   Planning to pay back debt of 400-450cr next year.   Cotton Woes -   Focusing the revenue is the target and because of the cotton inventory which we stored in recent past that is fairly well covered to next three four months so we will be able to see growth in coming quarters, for next quarter at least there is a bit concern in terms of additional cost in the cotton.   Usually have about four to six months kind of cotton inventory at March end.   Last year (FY17) the average procurement price of cotton during the season was around Rs.120-125 per kg. So when this new season started FY18, it has came down to around Rs.105-108 per kg and from that point of onwards the cotton inventories have started building up in Q3 and now the price of cotton again touched to at around Rs.120-125 per kg. Due to quality constraints, the prices have again moved up in January. They keep incremental inventories, so despite prices rising, their cost for q4 will be lower than that of the market. Though, q3 over Q4, cost be be little higher.   Maintenance capex (per year)  100cr for next 2 years each  Fund raising  This is an enabling resolution. No plans on the table as of now.  Impact of Forex fluctuation  At an approximate product value of Rs.500, it adds something like Rs.20-25 per kg kind of a product sale price, but see that is temporary. Whether that rupee appreciates or depreciates, it has an impact only for a quarter or two. At the end of that when your normal lead cycle is over either you have to pass on the benefit or you have to take the cost addition from the customers.  Guidance   With improved utilization, and all fixed costs accounted for, EBITDA margins will improve quickly. At 60%, EBITDA will move up by 2%.   Overall EBITDA margins will on sustainable basis be ~18%-22%.   My take Trident mgmt is guiding for minimum 18% EBITDA margin (where they are right now). Play is on improved utilization, reducing debt, good dividend yield. Cotton is an issue (due to which q2 was pretty bad), but mgmt said q4 will be better (as lot of hike will be passed through). Paper segment is providing stability (q4 will be better than q3). With US client restocking, utilization should improve for both bath and bed. Domestic textile is growing well and will grow for years to come at a very rapid rate. Indian textile is still competitive in USA vis a vis China and Pakistan.  A very decent low risk bet at 70 levels in my opinion.
